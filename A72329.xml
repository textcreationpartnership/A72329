            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="2">2 That the men who have diſputed theſe things, may be reduced to two ſorts and ſides.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſide affirmeth, that there is <hi>an abſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory decree</hi> proceeding from the alone pleaſure of God, without any conſideration of mens finall impenitency and unbeleef; by which God caſteth men off from grace and glory, and ſhutteth up the farre greater part, (even of thoſe that are called by the preaching of the Goſpell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſalvation) under invincible and unavoydable ſinne and damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:177938:5"/>The other ſide diſavowing any ſuch decree, ſaying, that <hi>Gods decree</hi> of caſting men off for ever, is grounded upon <hi>the foreſight of their continuance in ſinne and vnbeliefe,</hi> both avoydable by grace, and conſequently inferring no mans damnation neceſſarily.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſide is devided, for</p>
            <p n="1">1 Some of them preſent man to God in the decree of <hi>reprobation</hi> look't on out of, or above the fall: and ſay,</p>
            <p>That God of his meere pleaſure <hi>antecedent</hi> to all ſinne in the creature, <hi>originall or actuall,</hi> did decree to glorifie his <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> and juſtice in the eternall rejection and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greateſt part of mankind, as the end; and in their unavoydable ſinne and impenitency, as the meanes. And this way goe <hi>Calvin, Beza, Zanchius, Piſcator, Gomarus,</hi> and ſome of our owne Countrimen.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The reſt of that ſide, thinking to avoyd the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, to which that <hi>ſupralapſarian</hi> way lyeth open, fall downe a little lower, and preſent man to God in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation, <hi>lying in the fall</hi> and vnder the guilt of originall ſinne, ſaying,</p>
            <p>That God looking vpon miſerable mankind lying in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, did decree the greateſt number of men (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe men whom he calls to repentance and ſalvation by the preaching of the Goſpell) to hell torments for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and without all remedy, for the declaration of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere juſtice. This way went the Synod.</p>
            <p>The difference between them is not much, and even in their own account too ſmall a diſcord to cauſe a breach. Notwithſtanding this petty difference therefore, they agree well inough together, as we may ſee in the <hi>Hague</hi> confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Synod.</p>
            <p>In the conference at <hi>Hague,</hi> the Contraremonſtrants have theſe words; <note n="(a)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>After this in the Synod at <hi>Dort,</hi> they permitted <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to ſet downe his judgement in the upper way. And the Delegates of South-<hi>Holland</hi> were very indifferent

               <hi>Will ſinnes, ordaine men to ſinne, and would not at all, that all men bee ſaved:</hi> and beſides this, openly and peremptorily affirmed, that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe things were hold and maintained by them,</hi> they could not poſſibly keepe their owne ground, but <hi>muſt come over to the Remonſtrants.</hi> This man was not onely not cenſured, but publiquely <hi>declared</hi> in the Synod to be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>diſmiſſed onely with this kinde and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonition: that hee ſhould hereafter take heed of ſuch words, as might give offence to tender eares, and could not well downe with thoſe, who are yet vncapable of ſuch My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe inſtances it appeareth, that they of the firſt ſide can eaſily beare one with another in this difference. And (to ſay the truth) there is no reaſon why they ſhould quarrell about circumſtances, ſeeing they agree in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For they both contend,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the <hi>moving-cauſe</hi> of Reprobation is the alone will of God, and not the ſinne of man, Originall, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the finall impenitency and damnation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>unavoydable</hi> by Gods abſolute Decree.</p>
            <p>Theſe two things are the <hi>[maxima gravamina]</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall grievances that the other ſide ſticke at. So that theſe two paths meet at laſt in the ſame way.</p>
            <p>Both theſe opinions of the firſt ſide I diſlike.</p>
            <p>My reaſons why, are of two ſorts;
<list>
                  <item>1 Such as firſt made me to queſtion the truth.</item>
                  <item>2 Such as convince me of their untruth.</item>

            <p>MY reaſons of the firſt ſort doe indifferently reſpect and make againſt both, and I will ſet them downe againſt both together.</p>
            <p>My ſecond ſort of reaſons I will divide, delivering ſome of them againſt the upper and more rigid way, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againſt the lower and more moderate way.</p>
            <p>I begin with thoſe reaſons, which firſt moved me to queſtion the truth of abſolute Reprobation, as it is taught both wayes.</p>

            <p>In the Synod likewiſe at <hi>Dort,</hi> in the yeares 1618 and 1619, the Remonſtrants were warned by the Preſident of the Synod <note n="(d)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The opinion of the <hi>Stoickes</hi> was, that all actions and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents were unavoydable, determined either by the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the Heavens, and the qualities of ſuch ſtarres as raigned at mens births, or by the concatenation of naturall things and the diſpoſition of the firſt matter, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo put together from eternity, that one thing muſt needs follow another, as it doth; and the <hi>[prima materia]</hi> being ſo diſpoſed, that things cannot ſucceſſively come to paſſe otherwiſe then they doe, but muſt of neceſſity be as they are, even <hi>[invito deo]</hi> though God would have ſome things to be otherwiſe then they are.</p>

               </hi> held, that all mens actions, good or evill were determined too: good actions by a good God, who was the author of all good things that were created, and of all good actions that came to paſſe in the world; Evill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by an evill God who was the <hi>[primum principium mali] the prime author of all evill things or actions</hi> that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the world.</p>
            <p>The Maintainers of the Abſolute Decree do ſay one of theſe two things, eyther that all actions naturall and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, good and evill, and all events likewiſe are abſolutely
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177938:10"/>
neceſſary; ſo the Supralapſarians: or that all mens ends (at leaſt) are unalterable and indeterminable by the power of their wills; ſo the Sublapſarians. And this is upon the matter all one with the former. For firſt, in vaine is our freedome in the actions and meanes, if the end at which they drive, be pitched and determined; ſith all actions are for the ends ſake, that it might be obtayned by them, which without them could not. And ſecond, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the end doth neceſſarily involve the meanes that precede that end; as if a man be fore-determined to damnation, he muſt unavoydably ſinne, elſe he could not be damned.</p>
            <p>Now in theſe 3 opinions we may note two things.</p>

evill actions and unhappy events, from an evill God or the courſe of nature, then from the decree of that God, who is infinitely good. The ſubſtance of their opinions is all one, the ground wherein they differ is but accidentall to error.</p>
            <p>Which being ſo, for this very reaſon alone may this doctrine of abſolute Reprobation be ſuſpected: becauſe thoſe dreames of the Stoicks were exploded by the beſt Philoſophers of all ſorts; and this of the Manichees was generally cryed downe by the Fathers, not onely as fooliſh, but as impious and unworthy of entertainment in a Chriſtian heart, or Chriſtian Common-wealth, not ſo much for any thing circumſtantiall in it, as for the ſubſtance of the error; becauſe it made all things and events to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ſo plucked up the roots of vertue, planted vice, and left no place for juſt rewards or puniſhments.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> 1 For anſwer to this we are firſt to premiſe thus much, namely, that our ſlaughtering of our beaſts for our daily uſe, is by Gods ordnance and appoyntment: We had not this authority of our ſelves, but God of his bounty towards us, gave it us, as we may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.2.3. where we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Firſt, that God delivereth up all Creatures, beaſts, birds, and fiſhes into the hands of men. Secondly, that the end why he doth ſo, is, that they might be meat for men and conſequently that they might be ſlayne.</p>
            <p>Which being ſo, our ſlaughtering of oxen, ſheep, and other creatures for our daily uſe, is to be accounted Gods doing rather then ours. And therefore the obiection ſhould be made thus; God may without any breach of goodneſſe or iuſtice appoint brute creatures to be ſlayne for mans uſe: therefore he may ordeyne men to be caſt into hell torments for ever for his owne uſe, that is for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his ſoveraignty, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, I anſwer further, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon holds not: for there is little <hi>proportion</hi> between the obiects compared and leſſe between the acts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is but ſmall <hi>proportion</hi> between the objects, <hi>beaſts</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> creatures of a different nature and made for a different end. Beaſts are voyd of reaſon and liberty in their actions, creatures whoſe beings vaniſh with their breath, made onely for the uſe and ſervice of men upon Earth: but men are reaſonable and underſtanding creatures, able through the creators bounty to diſcern between good and evill, and according to their firſt principles, to chooſe the good and forſake the evill: they are the very image of Gods purity and eternity, and were made for the ſervice of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:177938:13"/>
God alone vpon Earth, and his bleſſed and everlaſting ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in Heaven.</p>
            <p>So that albeit there be a very great diſtance between God and men, yet nothing ſo great as betweene God and beaſts. It followeth not therefore, that if God may appoint beaſts to be killed of his own free pleaſure for mans uſe, he may with like equity and reaſon appoint men of his own will to deſtruction for his own uſe. We reade that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of his people many thouſand beaſts for Sacrifices, but not one man.</p>
            <p>The firſt borne of other creatures hee challenged for burnt offerings (except they were uncleane beaſts;) but the firſt borne of men were to be redeemed: which ſheweth, that he put a wide difference between the blood of men and beaſts. Beſides, in the 9 of <hi>Gen:</hi> he giveth men power to kill and feed upon all living creatures, but he ſtraitly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to ſhead mans blood, and giveth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the prohibition; <hi>Man is the Image of God.</hi> So that we may well conclude, that there is but ſmall proportion between the objects compared men and beaſts, in reſpect of this act of killing or ſlaughtering.</p>

            <p n="1">1 The ſpeech of our Saviour concerning <hi>Iudas:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 26.24.</note> 
               <hi>Woe be to that man, by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had beene good for that man, if he had never beene borne.</hi> Two things eſpecially are ſet forth in theſe words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Firſt, the <hi>miſery</hi> of <hi>Iudas</hi> the betrayer of his Lord, <hi>Woe be to, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the greatneſſe of his miſery, <hi>Jt had beene good, &amp;c.</hi> It is as much as if our Lord had ſayd, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> the Traytor ſhall be damned; and therefore ſo wofull will his condition be, that it had beene good and happy for him, if he had never received a being: good in earneſt as Interpreters doe generally expound it, not in the opinion and eſteeme of weak-minded, faint-hearted men onely, as ſome few underſtand it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Let it be granted that the Scripture ſpeaketh of things ſometimes according to mens opinions; yet without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to faſten ſuch an expoſition upon any Scripture, is to doe as Dunſes doe in the Schooles, who being not able to anſwer a place in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wherewith they are charged, ſhift it off and ſay, <hi>[loquitur ex aliorum ſententia] he ſpeaks according to the opinion of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 This Scripture cannot in reaſon be thus expounded,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe it is an argument and ground by which CHRIST declareth the truth or greatneſſe of the miſery of <hi>Judas; Woe to the man, &amp;c.</hi> And why woe? Becauſe it had been good, &amp;c. But it were no argument to ſhew his wofull eſtate by, to ſay that it had been good for him that he had never been borne, in the opinion of men who mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the caſe, but not in truth.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:177938:14"/>2 Becauſe this Expoſition would teach and encourage men to be Atheiſts and Epicures. In the ſecond of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> we reade, how voluptuous men do ſtir up one another to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the good things that are preſent, to fill themſelves with wine and oyntments, to leave ſome tokens of their jollity in every place, and to practice all manner of wickedneſſe: and what is their motive? A falſe perſwaſion that they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſoules ſhould dye with their bodies, and that they ſhould have no being after death. If this conceit could fleſh them thus in their impious and voluptuous courſes, how freely and eagerly (may we thinke) would they purſue their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſinfull delights, if they could be but once perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that after all their pleaſures they ſhall be in a better caſe, then if they had no being?</p>
            <p>Secondly, I oppoſe common conſent; where ſhall wee pick out a man, but will ſay (if he ſpeake from his heart) that he were better to vaniſh into a thouſand nothings, then to be caſt into hell? what is the reaſon why men are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd of Hell, when they are touched to the quicke with the conſcience of their ungodly lives, and the expectation of eternall vengeance, that with <hi>Job</hi> they curſe their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and wiſh an hundred times over, that they had never beene, or might ceaſe to be, that ſo they might not come into the place of torments; but becauſe they judge a being there to be incomparably worſe then no being any where? and why are men who are ſenſible of hell fire, ſo ſtrongly curbed and held in by the feare of feeling it, even from dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and beloved ſinnes, but becauſe they apprehend it to be the moſt terrible of all terribles! feare of beeing annihilated can never doe that which the feare of Hell doth.</p>
            <p>The third thing which I oppoſe is common ſenſe, which judgeth paines when they are extreame to be worſe then death. Hence it is, that <hi>Job</hi> being tormented in his body by the Devill, curſed his birth-day, magnified the condition of the dead, and wiſhed himſelfe in the grave, plainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the loſſe of his being before that miſerable being which he then had.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that men even of ſtouteſt and hardeſt ſpirits (as we ſee by daily experience) would (if they might
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177938:14"/>
enjoy their option) chooſe rather to have no bodyes at all, then bodyes tormented with the ſtone or gout, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſharpe or ſenſible diſeaſe. It is a knowne ſaying grounded on this judgement of ſence, <hi>[Praeſtat ſemel quàm ſemper mori] better it is to dye once, then to be alwayes dying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the Tyrant <hi>Tiberius</hi> knew very well: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not ſuffer thoſe, towards whom he purpoſed to exerciſe his cruelty, to be put to a ſpeedy death, but to lingring torments, as <hi>Swetonius</hi> reporteth of him in that chapter where he reckoneth up his barbarous and cruell practiſes.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The ſumme of all theſe propoſitions is this; God, who from all eternity appoynted many miſerable men to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and unavoydable torments, decreed for the bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout of their intended ruine, that they ſhould without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy live and dye in a ſtate of ſinne: and what he thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177938:18"/>
from everlaſting, he doth moſt powerfully effect in time, ſo governing, overruling, and working upon the wills of thoſe Reprobates, that they have no liberty or abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all in the iſſue, of avoyding their ſinnes, but muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity commit them.</p>
            <p>Thus they teach: and therefore by juſt conſequence they make God the author of ſinne; as it will plainly appeare by theſe following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is ordinary to impute ſinne to thoſe, who have not ſo great a hand in the production of it, as hath the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by the grounds of this opinion. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) The divell is called a <hi>father of lyes, Joh.</hi> 8.44. and by the like reaſon of all other ſinnes; and therefore <hi>he that committeth ſinne,</hi> is ſayd <hi>to be of the divell,</hi> and to be a child of the divell, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.10. and ſinne is called, <hi>a work of the divell, which the ſonne of God appeared to looſe, verſ.</hi> 8. And why is the divell ſo called, but becauſe he doth egge and allure men by inward ſuggeſtions and outward temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to fall into ſinne! This is all he doth or can doe. But God doth much more, if he neceſſitate and by his decree firſt, and next by his powerfull and ſecret working in the ſoules of men, determine their wills irreſiſtibly to ſin. For to determine is infinitely more then barely to perſwade; for as much as ſin muſt needs follow the determination, but not the perſwaſion of the will. God is therefore a truer cauſe of ſinne (by this doctrine) then the Divell.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Wicked men are eſteemed authors of their owne offences; becauſe they plot, purpoſe, chooſe and commit them, and are immediate agents in the acting of them.</p>
            <p>But God (by this opinion) doth more: for he overruleth the projects and purpoſes of wicked men, and by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable motion proceeding from an immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, carrieth all their deliberations, reſolutions, choyſes and actions preciſely that very way; ſo as they cannot chooſe but doe as they doe, whatſoeuer they may think to the contrary. They have indeed <hi>[potentiam in ſe liberam] a power in it ſelf free,</hi> to chooſe what they refuſe, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe what they chooſe, to determine themſelves this way or that way as liketh them beſt: but they have not <hi>[liberum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſum] a free uſe</hi> of this their power. God doth determine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177938:18"/>
their will before it hath determined it ſelfe; and maketh them doe thoſe onely actions, which his omnipotent will hath determined, and not which their willes out of any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dominion over their owne actions, have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. More rightly therefore, may God be called the Author of thoſe offences; for <note n="(u)" place="margin">Opera magis pertinent ad impera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad exequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note> deeds whether good or bad, are owned more truly by him that over-ruleth them, then by the ſervile inſtruments that onely execute and doe them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Wicked counſellers, and they who allure and adviſe men to ſinne, are accounted by God and men to be the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe ſinnes, to which they are the perſwaders; and have beene puniſhed for thoſe miſdeeds, which others through their inſtigations have committed. <hi>Jezabell A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi> wife, was reputed and puniſhed as the murderer of <hi>Naboth;</hi> becauſe ſhe counſelled and contrived the doing of it, as we may ſee 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 21.23.25. But what is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling to inforcing? Evill counſels may be refuſed, but an almighty power cannot be reſiſted? God therefore that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this (according to their doctrine) in the production of ſinnes, is much more an author of them, then hee that onely uſeth the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If we could finde out a King that ſhould ſo carry himſelfe in procuring the ruine and the offences of any ſubject, as (by this opinion) God doth in the effecting of the damnation and tranſgreſſions of Reprobates, we would all charge him with the ruine and ſinnes of thoſe his Subjects. <note n="(w)" place="margin">

Who will not ſay, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was the principall author of the <hi>deflouring</hi> of thoſe maides? In like manner (ſay the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177938:19"/>
               <hi>Supralapſarians)</hi> God hath a purpoſe of putting great ſtore of men to the ſecond death, but becauſe it is not lawfull for him by reaſon of his juſtice to put to death men innocent and without blame, he hath decreed, that the Divell ſhall defloure them; that afterward he may damne them. It followeth therefore, that God is the maine cauſe of thoſe their ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That God is the Author of mens ſalvation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, all ſides grant: and yet hee doth no more in the procuring of them, then theſe men report him to do in the Reprobates impenitency and damnation. The ſalvation and converſion of the Elect (ſay they) he hath <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>antecedently,</hi> without the fore-ſight of any deſervings of theirs, reſolved upon, and by irreſiſtible meanes in their ſeverall generations draweth them to beleeve, repent and endure to the end, that ſo they might be ſaved, and his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute decree accompliſhed. On the other ſide, the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſinnes and the finall impenitency of Reprobates, he hath of his alone will and pleaſure <hi>peremptorily</hi> decreed; this his decree he executeth in time, drawing them on by his unconquerable power and providence from ſinne to ſinne, till they have made up their meaſure, and in the end have inflicted on them that eternall vengeance, which he had provided for them. What difference is here in the courſe which God taketh for the converſion and ſalvation of the Elect, and the obduration and damnation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates? And therefore what hindereth, but that God (by their grounds) may as truly be ſtiled the prime cauſe and author of the ſinnes of the one, as of the converſion of the other?</p>
            <p>The Fathers thought it a plaine caſe: and therefore they did generally make ſinne an object of preſcience, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, and bent the moſt of thoſe arguments by which they refuted this foule aſſertion, againſt an abſolute, irreſiſtible, and neceſſitating decree, as I could eaſily ſhew, but that I feare to be overlong. Onely I will cite ſome few of thoſe Authors words, whom the learned and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Biſhop hath alledged in favour and for the defence of the <hi>Predeſtinarians</hi> and the mainteiners of <hi>Gotteſchalkes</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>

               <hi>Whoſoever ſayth, that God hath layd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraynt or a neceſſity of ſinning upon any man, he doth manifeſtly and fearfully blaſpheme God, in as much as he maketh him</hi> by affirming that of him, <hi>to be the very author of ſinne.

            <p>And thus (in my judgment) doth it plainly appeare that by abſolute Reprobation, as it is taught the upper way, God is made to be the true cauſe of mens ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Many diſtinctions are brought to free the <hi>Supralapſarian</hi> way from this crimination: all which (me thinke) are no better then meere deluſions of the ſimple and inconſiderate, and give no true ſatisfaction to the underſtanding.</p>

            <p n="2">2 That which neceſſitateth the will to ſinne, is as truly the cauſe of ſinne, as that which forceth it; becauſe it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſinne to be inevitably committed, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might be avoyded: and therefore, if the divine decree neceſſitate mans will to ſinne, it is as truly the cauſe of the ſinne, as if it did enforce it.</p>

For when two cauſes concurre to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of an effect, the one a principall over-ruling cauſe, the other but inſtrumentall and wholly at the devotion of the principal; then is the effect, in all reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be imputed to the principall, which by the force of its influxe and impreſſion produceth it, rather then to the ſubordinate and inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, which is but a meere ſervant in the production of it. We ſhall finde it ordinary in Scripture, to aſcribe the effect to the principall Agent. <hi>It is not ye, that ſpeak</hi> (ſayth CHRIST,) <hi>but the ſpirit of my father, that ſpeaketh in you.

            <p>In theſe and many other places, the effect or worke ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is taken from the inſtrument, and given to the principall Agent. Which being ſo, though mans will work with Gods decree in the commiſſion of ſinne, and willeth the ſinne which it doth; yet ſeeing what the will doth, it doth by the commanding power of Gods almighty decree, and ſo it doth that otherwiſe it cannot doe; the ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted cannot ſo rightly be aſcribed to mans will the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, as to Gods neceſſitating decree the ſuperior cauſe.</p>

               <hi>Jt would ſeeme,</hi> if this be ſo, <hi>that vertue and vice are nothing; but things are judged to be good or evill by opinion onely, which as good reaſon teacheth, is very great injuſtice and impiety.</hi> And ſurely well might he ſay ſo: for to what purpoſe was the Sonne of God made man, and being man made a ſacrifice for ſinne? why was the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the word and ſacraments ordeyned? to what end are heaven and hell propounded? why are exhortations, diſſwaſions, or any other meanes to hinder men from ſinne applyed, if ſinne be nothing but a meere opinion?</p>
            <p>CHRIST, the Chriſtian faith, the word and Sacraments and whatſoever according to the Scriptures hath been don for the applying of the pardon of ſinne, are all but meere ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, nay very impoſtures, if ſinne be nothing. And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is no matter at all, whether men be Chriſtians,

If either: then ſorrow, feare, or any other act of repentance whatſoever, may as well be ſpared as ſpent. This conceit being once drunke in, religion cannot long continue; for the affections have been the ſtrongeſt planters, and are the ſureſt upholders of it in the world. <hi>Primus in or be Deos fecit timor.</hi>

            <p>Offences if fatall, cannot be juſtly puniſhed.

            <p>In theſe the Apoſtles words are two <hi>(Alls)</hi> of equall extent, the one ſtanding againſt the other.</p>
            <p>An <hi>(All)</hi> of unbeleevers, and an <hi>(All)</hi> of objects of mercy: looke how many unbeleevers there be, on ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hath God a will of ſhewing mercy. And therefore, if all men of all ſorts and conditions, and every man in every ſort be an unbeleever; then is every man of every condition under mercy: and if every man be under mercy, then there is no preciſe antecedent will of God, of ſhutting up ſome and thoſe the moſt from all poſſibility of obtaining mercy.

               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note>
               <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh, &amp;c. God loved the world,</hi> ſayth the Text, that is, the whole lumpe of mankinde: therefore he did not abſolutely hate the greateſt part of men.</p>
            <p>Againe, God loved it fallen into a gulph of ſinne and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. For he ſo loved them, as to ſend his ſonne to redeem them; and a Saviour preſuppoſeth ſinne. He did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hate the moſt of them lying in the fall: for love and hatred are contrary acts in God, and cannot be exerciſed about the ſame objects.</p>
            <p>Many Expoſiters (I know) doe take [world] here in a reſtrained ſenſe, and underſtand by it the company of the Elect, or the world of Beleevers onely, but they have little reaſon for it (in my opinion;) for,</p>
            <p n="1">1 I thinke there can be no place of Scripture alledged, wherein this word <hi>[world]</hi> eſpecially with the addition of <hi>[whole]</hi> as 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of <hi>Joh. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2. (a place equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to this for the matter of it and a comment upon it.) I ſay no place (I thinke) can be produced, where [world] doth ſignifie onely the Elect, or onely beleevers; but it ſignifyeth, eyther all men, or at leaſt the moſt men living in ſome certaine place, and at ſome certaine time, but without
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177938:27"/>
diſtinction of good and bad, or if it be uſed any where more reſtraynedly, it is applyed onely to wicked and Reprobate men, who in their affections are wedded to the world and its tranſitory delights: and therefore do moſt properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this name.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Suppoſe it be granted, that (World) in ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is reſtrayned to the Elect; yet it cannot beare this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification here; — becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1 The words then would have a ſenceleſſe conſtruction. For thus would they runne; <hi>God ſo loved the Elect that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh, &amp;c.</hi> and if they run thus, this would follow: — There are two ſorts of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, ſome that do beleeve and ſhall be ſaved, others that do not beleeve and ſhall be damned: which is a diviſion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction unknowne in Divinity.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Beleevers and unbeleevers, damned and ſaved, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all mankinde: for there is no man but he is one of theſe. Now (world) in this place includeth beleevers and unbeleevers, the ſaved and the damned, as appeareth moſt plainly to him that layeth the 16, 17. and 18. verſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

            </p>
            <p>In theſe words, the Apoſtle delivereth two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1 That it is Gods will, that men ſhould enjoy a happy end, and be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That it is alſo his will, they ſhould have the meanes and make a good uſe of them in comming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, that ſo they might be ſaved. There is no let in God, but that all men may beleeve and be ſaved: and therefore there is no abſolute will, that many thouſand men ſhall dye in unbeleefe and be damned.</p>
            <p>Two anſwers are uſually returned, which I confeſſe give me little ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That by <hi>(All)</hi> here we are to underſtand all ſorts, and not every particular man in thoſe ſorts.</p>
            <p>It is true, that <hi>(All)</hi> is ſometimes ſo taken in Scripture; but (I beleeve) not here: for the very context ſheweth, that we are to underſtand by it the individuals and not the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177938:28"/>
kinds. In the firſt verſe there is a duty enjoyned. <hi>[J will that prayers and ſupplications be made for all men;]</hi> and in this verſe the motive is annexed <hi>[God will have all to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:]</hi> As if he ſhould have ſayd — Our charity muſt reach to all whom God extends his love to.</p>
            <p>God out of his love will have all to be ſaved: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in charity we muſt pray for all. Now in the duty, <hi>(All)</hi> ſignifyeth every man for no man though wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane is to be included from our Prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pray for them</hi> (ſayth our Saviour) <hi>that perſecute you: and pray</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle here) <hi>for Kings and all that are in authority;</hi> men in thoſe dayes, though the greateſt, yet the worſt, the very Lyons, Wolves and Beares of the Church: <hi>Pray for them.</hi> And if for them, then for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus in the duty it ſignifieth every man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it muſt have the ſame extent in the motive too, or elſe the motive doth not reach home, nor is ſtrong enough to enforce the duty.</p>
            <p>The ſecond anſwer is, that God will have all to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with his <hi>revealed will,</hi> but millions to be damned with his <hi>ſecret will.</hi>

            <p>But if this anſwer ſtand, then (in my apprehenſion) theſe inconveniences will follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Gods words (which are his revealed will) are not interpretations of his minde and meaning; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence are not true: for the ſpeech which is not the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the minde, is a lye.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That there are two contrary wills in God, a <hi>ſecret will,</hi> that many ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall irrevocably be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and a <hi>revealed</hi> will, that all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> may be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That one of Gods wills muſt needs be bad, eyther the ſecret or the revealed will. For of contraries, if the one be good, the other is bad: and ſo of Gods contrary wills, if one be good, the other muſt needs be bad. For, <hi>malum eſt contrarium bono.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Scripture is not ſo liable to the exceptions againſt the former teſtimony. For it is a negative propoſition and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177938:28"/>
muſt be taken diſtributively: and therefore ſpeaketh that in plaine termes, which is contrary to abſolute reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>That which is uſually replyed, is that the perſons here ſpoken of, are the elect onely, and ſuch as truely beleeve: God is not willing that any of them ſhould periſh.</p>
            <p>But the contrary appeareth in the text. For the perſons here mentioned are thoſe, toward whom God exerciſeth <hi>much patience,</hi> and <hi>long ſuffering;</hi> as it is in the words next going before. And who are they? Are they the elect, are they beleevers onely? No, but Reprobates rather, who dy for their contempt of grace. For it is apparent by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that God doth patiently expect the converſion even of them that are never changed, but dye in their ſinnes, as we may ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. Where we read that the <hi>patience</hi> of God was exerciſed toward thoſe, who in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> deſpiſed it, and went to priſon, that is, to Hell for it. Yea of all men, Reprobates are the trueſt and moſt proper objects of Gods patience, as we may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch as go on in ſinne, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up wrath to themſelves againſt the day of wrath, ſaith; that God uſeth patience towards them that he might lead them to repentance. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>He endureth</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>with much long ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction,</hi> In the 5 of <hi>Eſay, v.</hi> 2. and the 65 <hi>cap. v.</hi> 2. we may ſee the ſame thing. Reprobates therefore as well as others, my rather then others, doth <hi>Peter</hi> here ſpeake of, and ſaith, that God would have none of them to periſh: if they do periſh, it is through their owne fault and folly, and not Gods abſolute pleaſure, who would have no man to periſh.</p>

            <p>By all theſe and many other places that ſpeake condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally (for ought that I can ſee) it is cleere, that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh no man conſidered ſimply in the fall, till by actuall ſinnes and continuance in them he forſake God. Now if God reject no man from ſalvation in time and in deed, till he caſt off God; then ſurely he rejected no man in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and decree, but ſuch a one as he foreſaw, would reject and caſt off him. For Gods acts in time are regulated by his decrees before time. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>He worketh all things</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>according to the counſell of his own will:</hi> and therefore there muſt be an exact conformity between them, as between <hi>[regulam]</hi> and <hi>[regulatum,]</hi> the rule and the thing ſquared thereby. By whatſoever therefore God doth in the world, we may know what he purpoſed to do before the world; and by his actuall caſting men off when they grow rebellious and impenitent, and not before, we may certainly gather, that he decreed to caſt them off, for their foreſeen rebellion and impenitency, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is in ſubſtance all one, to caſt a man off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and to entertaine a reſolution to do it. Our <hi>velle</hi> and <hi>facere</hi> are all one in Gods account: and the reaſon is, becauſe where there is a deliberate and ſetled will, the deed will follow, if nothing hinder. Much more is Gods will and deed all one, ſeeing his will is omnipotent and irreſiſtible: and whatſoever he willeth directly and abſolutely, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly done, when the time commeth.</p>

            <p>SEcondly, it <hi>croſſeth</hi> ſome principall <hi>Attributes</hi> of God:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2</hi> It is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with God Attributes.</note> therefore it cannot be true. For God uſeth not to make decrees contrary to his own moſt glorious nature, and ſuch as are incompatible with theſe excellent Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, by which he hath diſcovered part of himſelfe to men. <hi>[Voluntas Dei ſemper ſequitur naturam ſuam]</hi> is a rule among Divines, <hi>Gods will alwayes followes his nature;</hi> the reaſon why, is given by the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God cannot deny himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things are here to be premiſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Gods chiefe attributes are thoſe perfections, in the manifeſtation of which by acts conformable to them, God is moſt glorified; which are <hi>Mercy, Juſtice, Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> For God is more honoured by the exerciſe of theſe among men, then by the putting forth of his unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſoveraignty;</hi> as a King is more renowned among his Subjects for his equity, candor and clemency, then for his dominion and authority, or any thing that is done only for the manifeſtation thereof. And there is good reaſon for it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Power</hi> is no vertue; but Holines, Mercy, Iuſtice, and Truth are: acts of power are not morally good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but are made good or evill by their concomitants. If they be accompanied with Iuſtice, Mercy, &amp;c. they are good; if otherwiſe, they are naught. For <hi>[juſtum oportet eſſe, quod laudem meretur] Nothing deſerveth praiſe, unleſſe it be juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Power</hi> and ſoveraignty may as well be ſhewed in barbarous and unjuſt actions, as in their contraries. <hi>Saul</hi> ſhewed his authority and power to the full in ſleying the Lords Prieſts, and <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> in caſting the three Children into the fiery furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Denne; but no Mercy, nor Iuſtice, nor any thing elſe that was good.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond thing to be preconſidered, is —</p>
            <p>That Iuſtice, Mercy, Truth, and Holineſſe in God are the ſame in nature with theſe vertues in men, though infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differing in degree; (as light in the ayre and the Sunne, are the ſame in nature, not degree:) and that which is juſt, upright and mercifull in men, is ſo in God too: and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177938:30"/>
by theſe vertues in our ſelves with acts conformable to them <hi>[tanquam ex pede Herculem]</hi> we may ſafely meaſure what are ſo in God. For otherwiſe theſe things will follow.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) The common and received diſtinction of divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes into <hi>communicable</hi> and <hi>incommunicable</hi> would fall to the ground. For againſt it this might be ſayd, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, mercy juſtice and ſincerity with other vertues that are in us, are not the perfections of God in a lower degree communicated to us, but things of a different nature.</p>

                  </gap>
               </note>(2) Men cannot be truely ſayd to be made according to Gods Image; nor when they are regenerated to be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the ſame image, and to be made partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature That picture cannot be the picture of ſuch a man, which doth not in his parts and lineaments truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him: no more can we be truely called the picture or image of God, if in our graces (in reſpect of which we are principally ſo called) there be not a lively reſemblance of Gods attributes.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) We may not ſafely imitate God, as we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded. <hi>Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math 5.48. 1.

            <p>Theſe two things being thus premiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mercy, juſtice and truth, are foure of his chiefe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, in the exerciſe of which, he taketh himſelfe to bee much glorified; and that we are to meaſure theſe attributes by the ſame vertues in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>I come to the proofe of my ſecond reaſon, againſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Reprobation ſtated even in the mildeſt and moſt plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible way.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And this that they ſay is agreeable to reaſon. For if we be fallen into the guilt of the firſt ſinne and the corruption of nature, onely becauſe we were in <hi>Adams</hi> loyns when he ſinned, and derive our being from him; then theſe two things will follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That we ſtand guilty of all the ſinnes which <hi>Adam</hi> committed from his fall to his lives end. For we were vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in his loynes as well after his fall as before, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very paſſage and variation of his life he was ſtill a principle of mankinde. But where doe we reade that we are guilty of any other of his ſinnes? To the firſt ſinne onely doth the Scripture entitle that ſinne and miſery, which entred into the world, and invaded all mankinde, as we may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16, 17, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That children are guilty of the ſinnes of all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, eſpecially of their immediate Parents. For they were in theyr loyns when they ſinned, and more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately then in <hi>Adams.</hi> But children are not guilty of their parents faults, nor obnoxious to their puniſhments, becauſe they are their children, as we may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. where God ſaying, that he will <hi>viſite the ſinnes of the Fathers upon the children to the third and fourth gener<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on in them that [hate]</hi> him; plainly implyeth, that children are not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply charged with their fathers ſinnes, but conditionally if they be <hi>haters</hi> of God as their fathers were; if by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their wicked parents, they become partakers of their ſinnes. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord ſignifies thus much in his Apology againſt the Cavill of the Iewes. For firſt he ſayth, that if a wicked man beget a ſonne that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Fathers ſinnes, and doth not the like, he ſhall not dye for the iniquity of his Father. This implyeth, that the derivation of being from the Parent doth not render the child obnoxious to the puniſhment of the fathers ſinne, nor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:177938:31"/>
conſequently to the ſinne. For the good childe is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, and yet the good childe is equally in the fathers loynes with the bad, and equally receiveth nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. the Lord telleth them expreſſely thus much, in two propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Affirmatively. The Soule that ſinneth, it ſhall dye.</hi> And that it may be knowne that he ſpeaketh excluſively, onely the ſoule that ſinneth, ſhall dye; he delivers his minde.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Negatively, The Sonne ſhall not beare the iniquity of the Father, neither ſhall the Father beare the iniquity of the Sonne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour in that wofull ſpeech of his to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.32, 34. <hi>Fulfill yee alſo the meaſure of your Fathers. Behold J ſend unto you Prophets, &amp;c. them ye ſhall kill and crucifie, that on you may come all the righteous bloud, &amp;c.</hi> Intimateth apparently, that the Phariſees were not inheritors of their Fathers ſinnes and puniſhments by birth; but by the commiſſion and imitation of their fathers ſinnes, they came to inherit both their ſinnes and plagues. Miſerable would our caſe bee on whom the ends of the world are come, if children ſhould be guilty of all their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors prevarications. What a world of ſinnes ſhould we be to anſwer for, perſonall ſinnes, parents, progenitors ſins, to a thouſand paſt generations? A thing with no reaſon to be imagined.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt thing.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, they ſay that God hath immutably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, to leave the farre greateſt part of mankinde in this impotent condition irrecoverably, and to afford them no power and ability ſufficient to make them riſe out of ſinne to newneſſe of life; and this decree he executeth in time; and both theſe he doth out of his onely will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>O this propoſition there be three branches.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 God decreeth to leave them.</item>
               <item>2 He doth leave them.</item>

of his moſt free pleaſure.</hi> This they joyntly affirme, and prove it by this reaſon eſpecially; All men were lookt on as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: If ſinne therefore were the cauſe that moved God to reprobate, he ſhould have reprobated or rejected all.</p>
            <p>But he did not reprobate all; therefore for ſinne he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated none, but for his own pleaſure, in which we muſt reſt without ſeeking any other cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe two things layd together, viz.
<list>
                  <item>1 That God did bring men into a neceſſity of ſinning.</item>
                  <item>2 That he hath left the reprobates under this neceſſity: it will follow that he is the author of the reprobates ſinnes.</item>

But God is the chiefe or ſole cauſe (by their doctrine) of that which is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and immediate cauſe of the ſinnes of Reprobates, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their impotency and want of ſupernaturall grace; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is (by the ſame doctrine) the true and proper cauſe of their ſinnes.</p>

But God (by their opinion) withholdeth from Reprobates that power, which being granted them, might keep them from falling into ſinne: therefore he becommeth a true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe of their ſinnes, — <note n="(s)" place="margin">

            <p>It will not ſuffice to ſay, that God by withholding grace from Reprobates becommeth onely an <hi>accidentall,</hi> not a proper and direct cauſe of their ſinnes. For a cauſe is then onely accidentall in relation to the effect, when the effect is beſide the intention and expectation of the cauſe. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: digging in a feild is then an accidentall cauſe of the finding a bag of gold, when that event is neither expected
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177938:33"/>
nor intended by the husbandman in digging, But when the effect is lookt for and aymed at, then the cauſe (though it be the cauſe onely by withholding the impediment) is not accidentall; as a pilot who withholdeth his care, and skill from a ſhip in a ſtorme, foreſeeing, that by his neglect the Ship will be drowned, is not to be reputed an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but a direct and proper cauſe of the loſſe of this ſhip. This being ſo, it followeth, that God by this act and decree of removing and detayning grace neceſſary to the avoyding of ſinne, from Reprobates, not as one ignorant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe what will or ſhall follow, but knowing infallably what miſchiefe will follow, and determining preciſely that, which doth follow; namely, their impenitency and damnation, becommeth the proper and direct cauſe of their ſinnes.</p>

            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Comparatively:</hi> with two things it is compared.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 His owne juſtice.</item>
               <item>2 The love that dwelleth in the creature: and is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced above both.</item>

            <p n="1">I. With his owne Iuſtice it is compared and advanced above it: not in its eſſence (for all Gods excellencies are

infinitely good; and one is not greater then another) but in its expreſſions, and ſome things that have relation to it: particularly in theſe;</p>
            <p n="1">(1) In its <hi>naturalneſſe</hi> and deareneſſe to God. It is ſayd of <hi>mercy,</hi> it <hi>pleaſeth him, Micah.</hi> 7.18. but juſtice is called <hi>his ſtrange worke [ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">(2) In the frequent <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it ſelfe. He is ſaid to be <hi>ſlow of anger,</hi> but <hi>abundant in goodneſſe. Exod.</hi> 34.6. mercies are beſtowed every day; judgements inflicted but now and then, ſparingly, and after a long time of forbearance, when there is <hi>no remedy,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15. <hi>All the day long have J ſtretched out my hands to a gainſaying and rebellious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Eſay,</hi> 65.2. That is, I have been patient a long time, and in that time I have not been idle, but imployed in exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, promiſing and ſhewing mercy, that ſo I might do you good. God waits a great while for the converſion of ſinners, as Marriners doe for theyr tyde: and at laſt with much adoe, if there be a neceſſity, he chideth and fighteth.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) In its <hi>amplitude</hi> or objects, to whom it is extended; Viſiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children <hi>to the third and fourth generation,</hi> but ſhewing mercy <hi>to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, Exod.</hi> 20.5. In theſe words God implyeth, that his mercy reacheth farther then his juſtice, and that, how much 3 or 4 come ſhort of a thouſand; ſo much doth his juſtice come ſhort of his mercy in the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) In the <hi>occaſions</hi> that move God to exerciſe them. It is a great matter that moveth God to puniſh, as we may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5, 6, 7, 12, 13. when the <hi>wickedneſſe of man was great in the earth, and all fleſh had corrupted his way,</hi> then God thinketh of a floud. He would not deſtroy the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, till their wickedneſſe was full. <hi>How oft would I have gathered thee?</hi> ſaith CHRIST to Ieruſalem, <hi>Mathew</hi> 23.37. that is, I have not taken advantages againſt thee, nor upon the firſt, ſecond, or third unkindnes, caſt thee off: ſmall matters have not moved me to deſtroy thee, O Ieruſalem. But how ſmall an occaſion doth God take to ſpare men? when he had examined <hi>Sodome,</hi> and found their ſinnes to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:177938:34"/>
be anſwerable to the cry, yet then, for ten righteous mens ſakes would he have ſpared <hi>Sodome, Gen.</hi> 18.32. Nay, he would have ſpared <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if the Prophet could by his ſearching have <hi>found one man who did execute judgment and ſeek the truth. Jer.</hi> 5.1. What a ſlender humiliation made him to ſpare wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> and his houſe a long time? 1. <hi>Kings,</hi> 21.29. And the repentance of <hi>Ninive,</hi> whoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe cryed to the Lord for vengeance, <hi>Ionah.</hi> 1.2. did eaſily procure her a pardon.</p>
            <p>Thus is Gods mercy advanced above his juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is compared alſo with the affection of a father to his ſonne, of a tender mother to her childe, and of the moſt affectionate bruits to their brood, and ſet above them all. It goeth beyond a fathers to his ſonne, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. <hi>If you that are evill, can give good guifts to your children; how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to them that aske him?</hi> What doth this <hi>(quanto magis)</hi> imply, but that Gods love out-ſtrips a fathers! And ſo it doth a mothers too. <hi>Eſay,</hi> 49.15. <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion upon the Sonne of her wombe? yea, they may forget; yet J will not forget thee.</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are compaſſionate toward their children, becauſe they are the fruit of their wombes, and a part of themſelves: but moſt indulgent are they toward thoſe children, to whom they are <hi>Nurſes,</hi> as well as <hi>mothers,</hi> to their ſucking children. And yet mothers may forget even their ſucking children: but as for God, he can never forget his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

            <p>But to deliver things a little more cloſely. Foure things
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177938:35"/>
(in my conceit) being well and diſtinctly conſidered, do make it apparent, that this decree is compatible with Gods mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne is the ſinne of mans nature onely and no mans perſonall tranſgreſſion, but <hi>Adams:</hi> it was neyther committed nor conſented to, by any of his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their own perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That it was the ſinne of our nature, not by generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as I have ſhewed) but by Gods own voluntary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That God did pardon it in <hi>Adam,</hi> (for ſo it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beleeved;) who did actually and freely commit it in his own perſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That CHRIST came into the world to take away <hi>[Peccatum mundi] the ſinne of the world. Joh.</hi> 1.29. That God eyther did or might have ſatisfied his wronged ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in the bloud of the Covenant for all mankind, and without any impeachment to juſtice, and have opened a way of ſalvation to all and every man.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations (I think) being well digeſted, will make any man to think, that eyther there is no decree of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Reprobation; or that God is not mercifull to men at all: much leſſe more mercifull to them then to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but more ſharpe a great deale and ſevere then he is to

            <p n="2">2 To the very Diuels alſo (ſuppoſing this decree) is God more mercifull, then to men; and yet the Divels are ſet forth in Scripture for the greateſt ſpectacles of Gods irefull ſeverity. In one thing, this decree maketh moſt men and Divels equall, <hi>[Vtriſque deſperata ſalus,]</hi> they are both ſure to be damned: but in three things, men are in a farre worſe condition by it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) In their appointment to hell, not for their <hi>owne, proper, perſonall ſinnes,</hi> for which only the Divels are damned: but for the ſinne of another man, that lived and ſinned long before they were borne.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) In their <hi>unavoydable</hi> deſtination to endleſſe miſery, under <hi>a colour</hi> of the contrary. The Divels, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to damnation, ſo they know it, they expect it, they looke for no other. But men, who are appointed to wrath, are yet fed up with hopes of ſalvation and made to beleeve that the whole buſineſſe is put into their hands; ſo as if they periſh, it is not <hi>[defectu miſericordiae]</hi> becauſe God will have no mercy on them, but <hi>[defectu vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis propriae,]</hi> becauſe they will not bee ſaved: when yet indeed there is no ſuch matter.</p>
            <p>Now if it be worſe to be deluded in miſery, then ſimply to be miſerable; then is the condition of men in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect (by this decree) much worſe then the ſtate of Divels.</p>

            <p>Nor doth that give me ſatisfaction, which is uſually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, namely, that God by this abſolute decree doth fully manifeſt his juſtice and mercy too: his juſtice toward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, his mercy toward the Elect; and that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary his decrees ſhould ſo be ordered, as that both theſe may be clearely declared by them.

            </p>
            <p>But now they cannot in juſtice be bound to beleeve, if they be abſolute Reprobates, for three cauſes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:177938:38"/>(1) Becauſe they have no power to beleeve: they want it and muſt want it for ever. God hath decreed they ſhall never have any to their dying day. <hi>[Nemo obligatur ad impoſſibilia]</hi> no man can be juſtly tyed to impoſſible performances. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man can flye like a bird, or reach heaven with the top of his finger; therefore, God cannot with juſtice exact of any the performance of theſe actions: nor can he of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the obedience of Faith, if it be not poſſible to them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Becauſe it is not Gods unfeyned will they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. No man will ſay, that it is Gods ſerious will, that ſuch a man ſhall live, when it is his will, that he ſhall never have the concourſe of his providence and the act of preſervation. Nor can we ſay, that God doth in good earneſt will that thoſe men ſhould beleeve, whom he will not furniſh with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power to beleeve. It may rather be ſayd, it is Gods unfey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned will they ſhall not beleeve, becauſe it is his will they ſhall want power to beleeve. For it is a Maxime in Logique, <hi>[Qui vult aliquid in causâ, vult effectum ex iſtâ cauſa profluentem.] He who willeth a thing in the cauſe, willeth the effect that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily floweth from that cauſe.</hi> Now if it be the certaine will of God, that Reprobates ſhall in no wiſe beleeve, hee cannot with reaſon and equity tye them to beleeve. For then he ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to an act contrary to his determinate will.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Becauſe they have no object of Faith, no Chriſt to beleeve in: <hi>[Credere jubet, &amp; fidei nullum obiectum ponit.]</hi> He commandeth to beleeve, and affordeth no object to beleeve in: this ſoundeth not well. The Divels have no part in Chriſt or the new Covenant. We will not therefore ſay, that God can juſtly bind them to beleeve, or puniſh them as tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Covenant; becauſe they beleeve not. How then can we ſay, that God can juſtly require faith of Reprobates, or deſtroy them for not beleeving; if they have indeed no more part in Chriſt or in the Covenant, then the Divels have? If a man ſhould command his ſervant to eate and puniſh him for not eating, and in the meane time fully reſolve, that hee ſhall have no meat to eat; would any reaſonable man ſay, that ſuch a man were juſt in the command or puniſhment? Change but the name and the caſe is the ſame. Againe, that Chriſt dyed for Reprobates (by the Doctrine of abſolute Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is a lye; and can God juſtly bind men to beleeve a lye?</p>
            <p>This is the ſecond reaſon.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:177938:38"/>3 The third reaſon why the abſolute decree infringeth Gods juſtice is, becauſe it will have him to puniſh men for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of an act, which is made impoſſible to them by his owne decree: not by that decree alone, by which he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to give them no power to beleeve, having loſt it; but by that decree alſo, by which he purpoſed, that we ſhould partake with <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſinne, and be ſtripped of all that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall power, which we had by Gods free grant beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us in <hi>Adam</hi> before he fell.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the reaſons which move me to thinke, that this abſolute decree is repugnant to Gods <hi>Iuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things are uſually anſwered.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Gods wayes may be very juſt, and yet ſeem unjuſt to mans erring underſtanding: and ſo is this decree, though fleſh and bloud will not yeeld it to be ſo.</p>
            <p>This anſwer I take to be falſe, and the contradictory to it to be true, namely, that nothing is truely juſt, which humane underſtanding purged from prejudice, corrupt affections and cuſtomes, hath in all ages, places and perſons judged to be unjuſt. The reaſon is, becauſe God hath by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and thoſe generall impreſſions of good and evill, honeſt and diſhoneſt, juſt and unjuſt, made in the hearts of men, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtructed and enabled them to judge what is juſt and what is not. When a thing is done, reaſon ſo quallified is able to ſay, This is juſt, or this is unjuſt whether it be done by God or man. For (vertues in men being but the image of thoſe perfections that dwell in God) Iuſtice in men and God are for ſubſtance but one and the ſame thing, though infinitly differing in degree, as the greater and leſſer light. That this power is ingraffed in men, God himſelf (who beſt knoweth with what endowments he hath beautified his creature,) hath ſufficiently ſignified in thoſe Scriptures, where he calleth on men to be judges of the equity of his wayes. <hi>Iudge J pray you between me and my vineyard, Eſay</hi> 5. <hi>Judge, O ye houſe of Iſrael, are not my wayes equall and your wayes unequall? Ezek.</hi> 18.25. God would never put them upon the tryall of reaſon, if he had not made it able to examine them. The incarnation of the ſonne of God, his birth of a Virgin, his dying, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, and ſuch myſteries, as are peculiar to the Goſpell, and the proper objects of the Chriſtian faith;

                  </gap> that pryeth into Gods majeſtie, will be overwhelmed of his glory.</hi> But of the juſtice of his decrees and wayes, he maketh him a judge; becauſe, the common notions of juſt and unjuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprinted in nature, he is able by naturall reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what is juſt in divine acts, as well as in his owne.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is anſwered, that theſe decrees are ſet downe is Scripture to be the will of God: and therfore, they muſt needs be juſt. For Gods will is the rule of all righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>To this anſwer, I have theſe things to reply.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) This rule in Divinity is much abuſed by the maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of abſolute Reprobation, and may not be admitted in their ſence and meaning. For Gods will is not a <hi>rule of juſtice</hi> to himſelf, as if things were therefore juſt, becauſe he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them and worketh them: but his juſtice rather is a rule of his will and works, which are the expreſſions of his will. He therefore maketh decrees and executeth them, becauſe they are agreeable to that juſtice which dwels in the divine nature: as he maketh nothing, which hath not <hi>[potentiam objectivam,]</hi> a power of being created without implying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to himſelf or any thing in him: ſo he willeth and doeth nothing, but that which may be willed or done, <hi>[ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vâ juſtitiâ]</hi> without wrong to his juſtice.<note place="margin">Hierom: Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:177938:39"/>
God doth not will a thing and ſo make it good; but willeth it, becauſe it is in it ſelfe good antecedently and before the act of Gods will about it.</p>
            <p>And thus much doth <hi>Zanchy</hi> (though a rigid mainteyner of abſolute reprobation) not obſcurely confeſſe in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, <hi>de nativ.

               <hi>this is true, where the King is juſt and willeth nothing but what is juſt.</hi> In which words, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh the iuſtice of the King antecedent to that will of his, which muſt be a law. Many more ſpeeches he uſeth there to the ſame purpoſe. Gods will therefore, is not a rule of Iuſtice to himſelf. To whom then?</p>
            <p>To us. For by it we are, (1) to ſquare all our thoughts, words, and deeds. (2) to examine them when they are ſpoken and done: <hi>[Primum in aliquo genere eſt regula poſteriorum, &amp; ſupremum inferiorum.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) I reply, that theſe abſolute decrees of mens inevitable ſalvation and damnation are no parts of Gods revealed will. The Scriptures teach us no ſuch matter.</p>
            <p>And therefore to ſay they are, is but a meere begging of the queſtion. It hath alwayes beene ordinary with falſe Teachers, to make Gods word a Father to their falſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they may ſtand the faſter and winne the greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. The Papiſts ground their tranſubſtantiation, and the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans their conſubſtantiation and ubiquity upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>[Hoc eſt corpus meum] This is my body, Math.</hi> 26. And the defenders of abſolute Reprobation do ſo too: they make their cauſe to be Gods, and entitle his word to it; becauſe they ſee it is the ſureſt way to defend it: being herein like to ſome contentious people, who being in law and having a bad cauſe which they are like to loſe, they entitle the King to it, that they may the better uphold it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Abſolute Reprobation can be no part of Gods revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will. The reaſon is, becauſe, it is odious to right reaſon, and begetteth abſurdities. For <hi>[Nulla veritas parit abſurda]</hi> no truth begetteth abſurdities. Divers truths are revealed in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177938:40"/>
Scripture which are above, but not contrary to right reaſon, whether they be matters of faith or life: faith and reaſon, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſcripture are both Gods excellent gifts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though there may be a diſproportion, yet there can be no repugnancy between them. The worſhip which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, is <hi>[cultus <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] a reaſonable ſervice. Rom.</hi> 12.2. and the word of God is [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,] <hi>milke reaſonable and without guile.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.</p>
            <p>Theſe things therefore being layd together, it will appeare to be but a meere ſhift and evaſion, when abſolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is proved to be unjuſt; and therefore unworthy of God; to ſay, Gods will is the rule of Iuſtice: this is part of Gods revealed will; and therefore moſt juſt, whatſoever reaſon may cavill and ſay to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Their third anſwer is, that God is not bound to reſtore men power to beleeve, becauſe they once had it and have loſt it through their own fault, as a maſter is not bound to renew his ſervants ſtocke, if he have waſted it by bad huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</p>
            <p>This anſwer doth not ſatisfie me. For I grant, that God is ſimply and abſolutely bound to no man, becauſe he is <hi>[agent liherrimum]</hi> a moſt free diſpenſer of his owne favours, where and what, and to whom he will, and no man is aforehand with God: <hi>[Quis prior illi dedit ut retribuatur] Who hath given unto him and it ſhall be recompenſed again? Rom.</hi> 11.35.</p>
            <p>But yet he is conditionally bound: for he hath determined and tyed himſelfe 3 wayes eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Decernendo,</hi> by decreeing. The Almighty is eternally ſubject to his own ordinances, or els he ſhould be mutable. And therefore, what gifts ſoever he hath decreed to men, he is bound to give them by vertue of his own decree.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Promittendo,</hi> by promiſing. We uſe to ſay promiſe is debt, it is Iuſtice to performe what it was free to promiſe: and whoſoever he be that promiſeth and payeth not, is guilty of a treſpaſſe (witneſſe <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira;</hi>) and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the kingdome of heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. If therefore God hath made a promiſe of any gift or grace to men; his promiſe bindeth him to performance, <hi>Nam ſemell emiſſum volat ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocabile verbum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Legem ferendo,</hi> by giving men a law to keep; which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:177938:40"/>
without ſupernaturall grace they can no more keepe; then they can eate a rock. By ſuch a law the ſupreme Lawgiver bindeth himſelf to his people, to give them ſuch power as may enable them to keep that law, or elſe he becommeth (as the evill ſervant in the parable ſtiled him) <hi>a hard maſter, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping where he ſowed not,</hi> and the very true and proper cauſe of the tranſgreſſion of that law. We ſhall finde God alwayes giving ſtrength when he giveth a command. When he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the creatures, to <hi>increaſe and multiply;</hi> he gave them a multiplying vertue: when CHRIST bade the lame man <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, take up his bed and walk;</hi> he put into his limbs an ability of walking: when Adam had a ſpirituall law given him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, which without ſpirituall ſtrength he could not; God gave him ſtrength anſwerable to the law, as Divines agree, conſenting to that noted ſpeech of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that Adam had <hi>[poſſe non cadere]</hi> though he never had <hi>[non poſſe cadere] a power and poſſibility,</hi> though no neceſſity of continuing in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>That I may bring this home to my purpoſe, I ſay, that God is bound to reſtore unto men power to beleeve, ſuppoſing theſe things that follow.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 That he hath vouchſafed to enter into a new Covenant of peace with men, when he needed not.</item>
               <item>2 That in that Covenant, he requireth obedience at mens hands, even at theirs that periſh.</item>
               <item>3 That he promiſeth eternall life to every man, if he obey and keepe the Covenant.</item>
               <item>4 That he puniſheth the diſobedient with everlaſting death.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe particulars ſuppoſed, the moſt free God who is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely bound to none, is engaged to give ability of beleeving unto men: nor can he juſtly without this gift puniſh the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient any more then a Magiſtrate having put out a mans eyes for an offence; can command this man with juſtice to reade a book; and becauſe he readeth not, put him to death: or then a Maſter (that I may returne the Simile in the anſwer) when he hath taken away from his ſervant the ſtocke which he hath miſimployed, can afterward exact of him a juſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the ſame ſtocke, and puniſh him, becauſe he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth it not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:177938:41"/>I conclude therefore, that the abſolute and inevitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of ſuch men as are called to beleeve in CHRIST, and puniſhed if they beleeve not; is utterly repugnant to the Iuſtice of God, and therefore can be no part of his word.</p>

If any man would goe about to challenge him with untruth, his challenge would eaſily appeare to be a calumny: the truth of God like the glorious Sunne will break through all the clouds of falſe accuſations, that ſeek to obſcure it. <hi>[Simile gaudet Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mili]</hi> Like loveth his like, <hi>God loveth ſuch, as are true of heart, Pſal.</hi> 51.6. and hath an hypocrite in utter deteſtation: and therefore, he muſt needs be true himſelf.

neither eat nor drink.

            <p n="3">3 In his <hi>threats</hi> and comminations alſo (by this doctrine) is God made to be hollow and deceitfull. For againſt what ſinnes are threats denounced? Alwayes againſt actuall ſins; we never read that they are thundered out againſt us for Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:177938:42"/>
ſinne: they intimate therefore that the ſinnes for which men goe to Hell, are their actuall tranſgreſſions. But if it be true that God decreed men to Hell for originall ſinne, that which thoſe threats import and ſignifie is not true, and ſo God is not ſincere in them. Beſides, all threatnings imply that the evill threatned may be avoyded. For therefore are they denounced, that men might by them be brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſo eſcape the evils threatned. But if ſome men be peremptorily ordained to deſtruction, then their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be prevented: and ſo the threatnings of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in this reſpect alſo) do ſignifie an untruth, and God in them dealeth not plainly with men.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In all the other things before mentioned, is God full of guile too (by this opinion;) namely, in his —</p>

            <p>Nay, the whole Miniſtery (wherein God commandeth, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth, chideth, entreateth, lamenteth, &amp;c.) if this be true, is but a meere impoſture, a giving of words without any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of anſwerable deeds; and an impoſture ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by how much the ſhew of kindneſſe is the heartier. For how can a good thing be offered with ſtronger ſhewes of a good meaning, then when it is offered with exhortations and intreaties to accept it, with cleare demonſtrations of the excellencies of it, with unfeyned wiſhes that the parties to whom it is offered, would accept it, and bitter lamentations for their folly in refuſing it? With all theſe inforcements is <hi>Gods</hi> tender of Salvation to Reprobates accompanied; and therefore in ſhew moſt hearty and ſerious.</p>
            <p>In a word, thus ſpeaketh <hi>God</hi> (by this doctrine) to Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the miniſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O ye Reprobates, (once moſt dearely beloved of me in your father <hi>Adam,</hi> but now extreamly and implacably hated, and by mine eternal &amp; uncontrollable order Sealed up under invincible ſin and miſery:) amend your lives, and beleeve in the name of mine onely begotten Sonne. If you repent and beleeve not, there is no remedy, you muſt be damned: but if you repent and beleeve, you ſhall bee ſaved; though your ſinnes be as red as Scarlet, I will make them as white as Wooll. Think not that I would have you dye, for I ſweare <hi>as J live, J will not the death of him that dyeth;</hi> I would have no man to periſh, but all to come to repentance. I beſeech you therefore be reconciled. I have cryed and called unto you, I have a long time waited upon you, that you might repent, and ſtill am I knocking at the doores of your hearts for entrance. <hi>O, that there were a heart in you to feare me, and keep my commandements that it might goe well with you for ever. What ſhall J doe unto you? how ſhall J in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you? Will you not be made cleane? When will it once be?</hi>
               </q> Can <hi>God</hi> ſpeake thus to Reprobates, who by his own decree ſhall never repent, nor bee ſaved, without the deepeſt diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:177938:43"/>That which is uſually ſayd to cleare the abſolute decree from this crimination, is, That <hi>God</hi> wiſheth the Salvation of the Reprobate ſeriouſly, but not abſolutely; he would have thoſe men ſaved who are not ſaved, but yet upon condition they will repent and beleeve. And therefore, though they do periſh, <hi>God</hi> is candid and ſincere in his offers of Salvation to them. For therefore do they periſh, becauſe they performe not the condition, and not becauſe God offereth not Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeriouſly unto them.</p>
            <p>But this anſwer is too ſhort: It is true indeed, God will have all men to be ſaved upon condition onely, that they will beleeve and repent, according to that ſpeech of S. <hi>Ambroſe, [Deus vult omnes ſalvari, ſi &amp; ipſi velint.] God would have all to be ſaved, if they themſelves would:</hi> For if he would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely have it ſo, what can hinder it? who hath reſiſted his will? and it is true likewiſe, that a conditionall promiſe may be ſerious as well as an abſolute: but then the condition muſt be poſſible to them, to whom the promiſe is made; and the performance of the condition muſt be a part of Gods will, as well as the Salvation promiſed: or elſe the promiſe cannot be candid and ſincere. <hi>[Conditio eſt oblata poteſtas aliquid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendi]</hi> a condition is the offer of a power of choyce. Where there is no liberty of choyce afforded, there is no true condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appointed. In ſubſtance it is all one to offer a curteſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a condition not poſſible, and not to offer it at all; and in circumſtance it is much worſe.</p>
            <p>In ſubſtance all one; The Lawyers tell us that a Contract made <hi>[ſub conditione impraeſtabili nullus aeſtimatur]</hi> under a condition not poſſible, is eſteemed no bargaine. And the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians rule is, that <note n="(o)" place="margin">Conditionalis propoſitio quae habet annexam conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem impoſſibilem, aequipollet ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neganti.</note> A conditionall propoſition which hath an impoſſible condition annexed to it, is equivalent to a bare Negation. It is all one for me to offer a peece of mony to one blinde man upon condition he will open his eyes and tell me what peece of money it is, and what ſtampe it hath; and to deny it flatly to another. For the one hath it no more then the other. And it is all one for a man that hath a daughter to beſtow in marriage, to tell her Suiter; I will give you my Daughter, if you will ſpan the Earth, or touch the Heavens with your finger; and to tell him plainly, ſet your heart at reſt, I will never beſtow her upon you. For the Suiter ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth both wayes alike.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:177938:44"/>And it is in circumſtance a great deale worſe. For it is a denyall under colour of the contrary, a denyall joyned with a ſcoffe, a deriſion, as was that of the Iebuſites, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.6. Who told <hi>David,</hi> that he ſhould not enter into the Fort of Zion, <hi>except he tooke away the blinde and the lame.</hi> Their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, they would never deliver it up unto him: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought it impoſſible for him to take away the blinde and the lame, they told him if he did ſo, then they would yeeld it up. It was an Ironicall and ſcoffing denyall of his demand. If the King ſhould make an unrepealable Law, that no <hi>German</hi> ſhould be made a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> or free Denizen of the Kingdome; and then make a Decree to give ſome bountifull gratuities, but to the Citizens of London, or to the Subjects of the Kingdome only, and to none but them; and yet for all this ſhould command it to be proclaymed, that he will give them to the <hi>Germans</hi> upon condition they will be made Freemen of London, or bee incorporated into the Kingdome: would not any man ſay, that the King in this caſe did diſſemble and delude the poore Dutchmen? and if any ſhould ſay, there would be no diſſembling in it; for if they would become Citizens or Subjects, they ſhould have the promiſed gratuities: a man might truely anſwer, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King doth counterfeit and coſin them, becauſe hee maketh a tender of them upon a condition not poſſible by his owne decree. In like manner, if God have made a decree, that ſuch men ſhall never beleeve, and yet offer them Heaven on condition they will beleeve; it may moſt truely be ſayd, that God doth not onely deny them Heaven, but deny it with a bitter deriſion, which is farre from that candor and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that dwelleth in him.</p>
            <p>And thus have I ſhewed the contrariety of this Opinion to foure principall attributes of God, which is my ſecond generall reaſon againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3 It is contrary to the uſe &amp; end of <hi>Gods gifts</hi> to men.</note>THirdly, it is contrary to the uſe and end of <hi>Gods gifts</hi> beſtow'd upon men, which gifts are of two ſorts:</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:177938:44"/>
to everlaſting life, and are meanes eyther of purchaſing Salvation or of applying it.</p>
            <p>Meanes of purchaſing it, are the comming of CHRIST in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and the ſacrificing himſelfe on the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>Meanes of applying it, are the miniſtery of the word and Sacraments, the long ſuffering of God, the enlightening of mens underſtandings, the plantation of many excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in their hearts, with many more of the like ſort.</p>
            <p>Now of theſe endowments of Nature and Grace, what the true uſe and end is, the Scripture doth plainly and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſhew us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for guifts of <hi>Nature,</hi> we finde them beſtowed upon all that have them, for the encouraging and enabling of them to ſerve God and ſave their Soules. For, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16, 17. The Apoſtle ſaith, that God (even in thoſe times in which he ſuffered the Gentiles to walke in their own wayes, and with-held from them the light of his holy word) did give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people of the world, <hi>raine from Heaven and fruitfull ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, filling their hearts with food and gladneſſe,</hi> and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he left not himſelfe among them <hi>without witneſſe.</hi> This implyeth, that therefore he gave them theſe good things, that he might make himſelf knowen unto them, and ſo might draw them to glorifie him according to the knowledge which they had of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26. The Apoſtle ſaith directly, that therefore men are made and placed in this world and appoynted to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times and dwellings, <hi>that they might ſeeke and finde God:</hi> that is, that they might ſerve him and ſave their Soules.

the Gentiles (as the foule-mouth'd <hi>Manichees</hi> ſayd, he dealt with the Iewes) to feed and fat them up with outward and more common bleſſings, as ſo many Hogs and Swine with husks and akornes, but to draw them up by theſe to an expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of better things and a carefull endeavor to pleaſe God, that ſo they might obtaine them.</p>
            <p>The end of all Creatures and of all created gifts beſtowed upon man, is ſubordinate to the end of man.

               <hi>They that ſay, that all thoſe to whom the Goſpell is preached (even thoſe that obey not the Goſpell) are not called to grace, they ſay an untruth. God looked for Grapes</hi> (ſayes the Text) <hi>Eſay,</hi> 5.2. What
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:177938:46"/>
doth this imply? but that it was Gods principall ayme in the husbandry which he beſtowed upon the Church of Iſrael, that it ſhould bring forth good fruit, though in the event it did not? <hi>How oft would J have gathered you?</hi> ſayth CHRIST to Ieruſalem. <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>have I ſpoken to you, that ye might be ſaved: but ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. Ioh.</hi> 5.34, 40. In thoſe words intimating no leſſe then this, that it was his full intent by his preaching to gather and to ſave thoſe very particular men, that in the end were not gathered nor ſaved, through the contempt or neglect of CHRISTS Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Touching the Sacraments, this is alſo the uſe and end for which they were ordayned; as we may ſee, <hi>Luke,</hi> 7.30. Where we have theſe words; <hi>But the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and expounders of the Law deſpiſed the counſell of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves; and were not baptized of Iohn.</hi> In which words thus much is evidently included, that it was Gods counſell and purpoſe in <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſme to bring them to CHRIST, and in him to Heaven. So much alſo is ſayd of his Baptiſme, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.4. Iohn <hi>did baptize in the Wilderneſſe and preach the baptiſme of Repentance, and remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> If this were the end of <hi>Iohns,</hi> much more is it the end of CHRISTS baptiſme; it being more excellent then <hi>Iohns</hi> was, not in ſubſtance, but in the fulneſſe of grace adminiſtred and diſpenſed by it. <hi>All that have been baptized into</hi> CHRIST (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>have been baptized into his death.</hi> Rom. 6.3. <hi>All yee that have been baptized into</hi> CHRIST, <hi>have put on</hi> CHRIST, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. The very phraſes there uſed, ſhew that baptiſme is in its originall intention, an inſtrument of uniting men to CHRIST, and giving them communion with him in the benefits of his death. <hi>Except a man be borne againe of water</hi> (ſayth our Saviour) <hi>and of the Spirit, he cannot, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 3.5. In which words are theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The neceſſity of regeneration. <hi>[Except a man be borne againe.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 The working cauſe of it: Efficient, <hi>the Spirit;</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall the Sacrament of Baptiſme, there called <hi>Water</hi> from the outward matter of it. Baptiſme therefore is appoynted to be a meanes of regeneration to all thoſe that are baptized, and doth effect it in all, who do not put an obſtacle in the way
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:177938:46"/>
to hinder it. So much doth the Apoſtle aſcribe to Baptiſme, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. and for this cauſe doth dignifie it with this title, <hi>[The laver of regeneration.] Tit.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>I will ſhut up this with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. where <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you for the remiſſion of ſinnes;</hi> plainly implying, that therefore is baptiſme ordeyned to be received, that thoſe who do receive it, might have their ſins remitted.</p>
            <p>This is alſo Gods intent in the Lords Supper. <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> (ſaith CHRIST) <hi>and this is my bloud, Math.</hi> 26.26, 27. in thoſe words teaching us, that in that Sacrament there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of CHRIST and his benefits intended on Gods part, and received of thoſe by whom no obſtacle is interpoſed: and therefore doth the Apoſtle call it in expreſſe words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The communion of the body and bloud of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this end alſo, is the patience of God (another ſingular dignation of God) exerciſed among men, as we may ſee, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe and forbearance, not knowing that the bountifulneſſe of God leadeth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? but thou after thy hardneſſe and heart that cannot repent, heapeſt up wrath to thy ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words may be noted for our purpoſe: (1) Gods intent in forbearing ſinners, which is, <hi>the leading of them to repentance,</hi> and ſo on to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: (for repentance, is <hi>per ſe ordinata ad ſalutem,</hi> by him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned to Salvation as a meanes to the end.) (2) The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom God intendeth this good by his forbearance: and they are, ſuch as <hi>deſpiſe the riches of his goodneſſe,</hi> and have <hi>hard and impenitent hearts.</hi> (3) The iſſue and event of this their contempt of Gods patience, and that is, <hi>a treaſuring up of wrath unto themſelves againſt the day of wrath.</hi> Out of all which layed together ariſeth thus much, that God by ſparing wicked men, who have hard and impenitent hearts, intendeth their everlaſting good, though they by the abuſe of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and refuſall to repent, doe treaſure up unto themſelves wrath and miſery everlaſting. The like to this is delivered in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>God is not ſlack</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) (as ſome men count ſlackneſſe) but patient toward us?</hi> that is us men. And why patient toward us? <hi>becauſe he would have none to periſh.</hi> The end therefore of Gods patience, is mans Salvation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:177938:47"/>In the laſt place thoſe other gifts of God, by which mens underſtandings are enlightened, and their ſoules beautified (namely knowledge, faith, repentance, fortitude, liberality, temperance, humility and chaſtity, and ſuch like) are beſtowed upon all that have them [among whom are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who prove Reprobates in the end] that by the exerciſe of them and continuance in them they might come to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
            <p>That Reprobates are adorned with many of theſe graces, appeareth by ſundry Scriptures, eſpecially <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. where the Apoſtle ſayth, That it is <hi>impoſſible for them that have bin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, taſted the heavenly gift, beene made partakers of the Holy Ghost, taſted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come; if they fall away, ſhould be renewed by repentance.</hi>

For, <hi>if we ſinne willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after wee have received the knowledge of the truth; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more Sacrifice for ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> From whence we may collect, that men who ſinne willingly and unpardonably, may receive the knowledge of the truth; yea and be ſanctified by the bloud of the Teſtament and the Spirit of grace, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29.</p>

Now all theſe vertues and graces are not therefore given then that they might abuſe them, and ſo purchaſe to themſelves the greater damnation; or that they might doe good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with them, but none to themſelves: but rather, that (as by the former gifts of nature, ſo) by theſe of grace they may obtayne Salvation. For if God ayme at this in thoſe gifts that are farther off, much more in theſe, which make thoſe that

               <hi>There are certain internall works preparing a man for juſtification, which by the power of the word and Spirit are wrought in the hearts of men not yet juſtified; ſuch as are the knowledge of Gods will, a ſenſe of ſinne, feare of puniſhment, &amp;c.</hi> that is their firſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Out of theſe two Theſes thus much ariſeth, that God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the knowledge of his will, the ſence of ſinne, feare of hell, hope of pardon, and conſequently many other excellent graces in the hearts of men, that by theſe, they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſo eternally ſaved.</p>
            <p>We ſee by theſe things, what end God aymeth at in his gifts to men.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome Scriptures, that ſeeme to ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, namely <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. where God is ſayd to reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Gentiles by the creatures, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>that they might be without excuſe.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 2, 34. <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaith of CHRIST, that <hi>he is appoynted for the falling and riſing againe of many in Iſrael.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I preach Chriſt</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) to the Jewes a ſtumbling block,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. We are the favour of death to death, &amp;c. By theſe places it ſeemeth, that God giveth theſe things to ſome, to make them ſtumble, and that they might be left without excuſe. What ſhall we ſay therefore to theſe places.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe places in generall, I may ſay this; that they are to be underſtood of the end, which is many times effected by theſe gifts of God, and not of the end which is primarily intended in them; and they ſhew what CHRIST, the word preached, and the gifts of nature and grace are [occaſionally] to ſome men, through their voluntary rebellion againſt God and his ordinances, and not what they are [intentionally] in Gods firſt thoughts and reſolutions: he intendeth them for their good, though many times they receive them to theyr hurt. It is with Gods ordinances and gifts (and that very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:177938:48"/>
too,) as it is ſometimes with phyſick: it is given by the Phyſician for the patients good, but many times through the diſtemper of his body, it doth him hurt. And as it is with the Sunne. God intendeth by the ſhining of it the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and clearing of men and other creatures in this inferiour world; and yet ſome men are hurt by the light of it, others are ſcorched by the heat of it; [accidentally] by reaſon of the climates wherein they live, or the ill affectedneſſe of theyr eyes and bodyes.</p>
            <p>So the bleſſings of God, which out of his abundant good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are beſtowed on men for theyr eternall good; through their ill frame and temper of heart doe effect their hurt, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe lighting on naughty hearts, they loſe their edge; (for <hi>quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis:</hi>) and partly becauſe of the ſeverity of God, who as he hath an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and gracious will to doe men good; ſo hee hath a conſequent and judiciary will of giving up obſtinate men to their own hearts luſts, and of permitting them to daſh againſt CHRIST and other meanes of eternall life, and ſo to fall into endleſſe miſery and miſchief, as we may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. which made <hi>Proſper</hi> ſay, <note n="(u)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Proſp. reſp. ad obj.</hi> 16. <hi>Vincent.</hi> Qui voluntatem Dei ſpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt invitantem, voluntatem Dei ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient vindicantem.</note> 
               <hi>They that have deſpiſed Gods inviting will, ſhall feele his revenging will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be the meaning of theſe Scriptures, then do they not thwart that which hath bin ſayd of Gods gracious intent of promoting the eternall good of men by his bleſſings beſtowed upon them. For, <hi>[argumentum ab eventu ad inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Dei non valet:)</hi> becauſe no ſinfull event is properly under Gods decree, but his preſcience only, or at moſt under a permiſſive decree: and many things happen in the world which are beſide the antecedent and principall purpoſe of God; not becauſe there is any want of power in God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his will is oftentimes conditionall, and therefore not effected; becauſe the condition is not performed.</p>
            <p>But by the opinion of abſolute Reprobation, the gifts both of Nature and Grace have another end: eyther God doth not meane them to thoſe that periſh (although they doe enjoy them, becauſe they are mingled in the world with the Elect to whom onely they are directed:) or if he doe, hee meaneth they ſhall have them, and be lifted up by them above the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p n="3">(3) The Miniſtery of the word cannot leave men without excuſe. For Reprobates may have this juſt plea; <q>Lord, doeſt thou puniſh us for not beleeving in thy Sonne, when thou didſt call us to beleeve by the preaching of thy word? why?

            </p>
            <p>MY fourth generall reaſon againſt this abſolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, It is a hinderance to <hi>Piety:</hi>
               <note place="margin">4th. Reaſon. Jt is prejudiciall to <hi>Piety.</hi>
               </note> it is a Doctrine that ſerveth greatly to diſcourage holineſſe and encourage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe. It maketh Miniſters (by its naturall importment) negligent in their Preaching, praying, and other ſervices, which are ordeyned of God for the eternall good of their people. It maketh people careleſſe in hearing, reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inſtructing their families, examining their conſciences, faſting and mourning for their ſinnes, and all other godly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. In a word, it cutteth a ſunder the very ſinewes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and pulleth away the ſtrongeſt inducements to a holy life. Therefore it is no true and wholſome Doctrine.</p>
            <p>That it doth ſo, it will appeare by theſe reaſons that follow.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It taketh away [Hope] and [Feare:] Hope of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning any good by godlineſſe; feare of ſuſteyning any hurt by wickedneſſe: and ſo it taketh away two principall props of Religion.</p>
            <p>This reaſon may be reſolved into theſe two branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Hope and feare uphold godlineſſe. Were it not for theſe, it would come to ruine: by theſe, are men ſtrongly led on to vertue, and with-held from vice. Hope doth <hi>[excitare]</hi> ſtirre men up to begin, and <hi>[corroborare]</hi> ſtrengthen them in the doing of any good action begun. By this hope of Heaven did our Saviour ſtirre up himſelfe to <hi>endure the Croſſe, and deſpiſe the ſhame. Heb.</hi> 12.2. By this he heartned his Diſciples to doe and to ſuffer for his ſake. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32. By this have all the godly in all ages encouraged themſelves in well doing, as we may ſee in generall. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12, 13: And in particular, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Abraham</hi> left his Country and Kindred at Gods call, <hi>becauſe he looked for a City, whoſe builder and maker was God.</hi> ver. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Moſes</hi> left all the <hi>pleaſures</hi> and treaſures of Egypt, <hi>and endured afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the people of God, becauſe he ſaw him that was inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and had respect to the recompence of reward,</hi> ver. 25.27.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177938:50"/>
The Martyrs endured racks, gibbets, lyons, ſword, fire, with a world of other torments, becauſe <hi>they looked for a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> ver. 35. <hi>Paul</hi> indeavoureth <hi>alwayes to keepe a cleere conſcience,</hi> through the hope which he had of a bleſſed reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.15. All the noble and heroicke acts of active and paſſive obedience, have ſprung from the hope of eternall glory. Souldiers, Merchants, Husbandmen, all are whetted on by hope to diligence in their callings, as dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience ſheweth us. Hope, ſayth <hi>Aquinas [confert ad operationem] conduceth to action:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1, 2, <hi>q.</hi> 40. <hi>art.</hi> S.</note> and he proveth it: firſt by Scripture, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. <hi>He which eareth and threſheth, muſt eare and threſh in hope.</hi> And then he proveth it by a twofold reaſon. 1 From the nature of Hopes object, which is <hi>[be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num arduum, &amp; poſſibile haberi] ſome excellent good attainable by induſtry. [Exiſtimatio ardui excitat attentionem]</hi> hope to get that by paines, which is conceived to be a thing of worth, ſtirreth up to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines taking. 2 From the effect of hope, which is, <hi>[detectat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o]</hi> an inward pleaſure, which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that liveth under hope, is affected with by his hope. There is not any man, which hath an inward contentment and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of heart in the worke be hath to doe, but goeth on merrily. The hope of Heaven therefore is a great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to piety.</p>
            <p>The feare of Hell alſo is a ſtrong curbe to hold men in, from impiety, and therefore (ſayth one) God hath planted in men a feare of vengeance, that by it as the ſhip by the Rudder, the ſoule may be preſently turned aſide from any rocks gulfes, or quickſands of ſinne, when it is neare them, and may ſteere its courſe another way. For this cauſe feare of God and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from evill are often joyned together in Scripture, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17. And the want of this feare is made the root of all licentiouſneſſe in ſinning. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.11. Nor doth feare onely hinder a bad action, but it promoteth a good. It hindereth a bad action [directly] becauſe it is <hi>[fuga mali]</hi> a flying from that evill of miſery which is annexed to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of ſinne: and it promoteth a good action [accidentally,] becauſe men thinke that they are never ſo ſafe from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which they feare, as when they are exerciſed in ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as tend to the getting of a contrary ſtate. <hi>Work out your ſalvation</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>with feare and trembling;</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:177938:50"/>
implying that the working out of ſalvation goeth not on handſomely, except the feare of mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling it be an ingredient into the worke.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch of this reaſon is, That by the abſolute decree, Hope and feare are taken away. For hope is properly exerciſed about <hi>[bonum poſſibile haberi]</hi> ſome good thing which may be obtayned, not which muſt be obtayned of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: and the object of feare is <hi>[malum poſſibile vitari,]</hi> an evill that may be eſcaped. For <hi>[metus eſt fuga mali]</hi> feare is a fleeing from evill: and therefore ſuppoſeth the evill to bee avoydable. For no man will flee from an evill that cannot be prevented, but will yeeld up himſelfe to it, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did his body to the murtherers in the Senate houſe. Now (by this decree) Heaven and Hell are not objects poſſible but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Heaven ſhall unavoydably be obtayned by thoſe that are elected, and Hell muſt as certainly be endured by thoſe that are reprobated. For men have no power to alter their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſtates: all men by this decree are preciſely determined <hi>ad unum,</hi> to one ſtate, to neceſſary ſalvation or neceſſary damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without any power or liberty to chooſe whether.</p>
            <p>And from hence this concluſion is cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, that the abſolute decree taketh away the chiefeſt inducements to holineſſe, and deterrements from wickedneſſe, and conſequently hindereth a godly life exceedingly.</p>
            <p>The Injuriouſneſſe of this doctrine to a godly life may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare by theſe conſiderations that follow, one depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon another.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Abſolute and peremptory decrees are inevitable, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the things be about which they are exerciſed: and mens everlaſting ſtates if they be abſolutely determined, are altogether undeclinable. <hi>[Stat fati lex indeclinabius]</hi> the law of deſtiny is undeclinable. And the reaſon is, becauſe it hath an inevitable cauſe, the Adamantine decrees of Almighty God, which are indeclinable two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Jrreverſible,</hi> lyable to no repeale (as the Statutes are which are made in our Parliaments:) but farre more unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſtatutes and ordinances, becauſe they ſee ſome inconvenience in them being made, which they could not foreſee: but God never calleth in his decrees, becauſe they are all made in great Wiſdome.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Jrreſiſtible.</hi> It lyes not in the power of any creature to diſanull them. <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Rom. 9.19. <hi>Our God is in Heaven: hee doth whatſoever he will.</hi> Pſal. 115.3. Whatſoever is once concluded by his abſolute will, is no wayes alterable by the will of man. It is more poſſible for a man to hinder the riſing of the Sunne, or to ſtay his courſe in the Heaven, to ſtop the revolutions of the yeare, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the whole courſe of nature, then to make the leaſt change in any of Gods abſolute decrees.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Mens actions about ends and things determined by an abſolute decree are vaine and fruitleſſe; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot make them otherwiſe then they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be. It is abſolutely decreed, the Divels ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Were it not a fruitleſſe thing in them by prayers, teares, and endeavors to ſeeke to alter it? It is alſo ſimply decreed, that the Soule of man ſhall be immortall. Is it not a labor in vaine for any man to uſe meanes that his Soule may be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated? It is ordained, that the Sunne ſhall rule the day and the Moon the night; that the one ſhall finiſh his proper courſe in a yeare, the other in a Moneth. Would not a mans indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make an alteration in theſe things bee unprofitable and ridiculous? Without doubt it would. So likewiſe, in vain do men labour to obtaine everlaſting life, and avoyd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death; if there be no power and liberty in their hands to chooſe life or death, but muſt of neceſſity take that which is aſſigned them, be it life or death. For by their labour they effect juſt nothing: if they bee abſolutely appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; theyr hearing, reading, praying, almeſ giving, and mourning for their ſinnes cannot poſſibly procure theyr Salvation: damned they muſt be. And if they be abſolutely ordayned to Salvation, theyr neglect of holy duties, their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, their love of pleaſures, and continuance in a courſe of ungodlineſſe cannot bring them to damnation, they muſt be ſaved. If ſo many Soules in a Pariſh, be in this manner decreed to Heaven or Hell; the Miniſter preacheth in vaine, and the people heare in vaine. For there cannot one Soule bee ſaved
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:177938:51"/>
by all his or their paines, which is ordayned to Hell; nor one Soule be caſt away by his or their negligence, which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Heaven.</p>

            <p>From theſe three premiſſes layed together it followeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, that the doctrine of an abſolute decree, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth mens ends preciſely; is no friend at all to a godly life. For if events abſolutely decreed be unavoydable; if mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about unavoydable ends be unprofitable; if in unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imployments men will have no hand willingly: whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

they be that beleeve and conſider this, will have nothing to do with the practice of godlineſſe. For their ends being abſolutely pitched and therefore unavoydable; they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that their labour in religion will be unprofitable, and ſo will not labour in it at all.</p>
            <p>That which hath been ſayd, may be yet confirmed by two Witneſſes. The one of them is Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> who in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions hath theſe words; <note n="(f)" place="margin">

               <hi>Jf any man</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſhould ſpeake thus to the people; If there be any among you that beleeve not, it is becauſe ye are ordained to deſtruction; this man would not onely cheriſh ſlothfulneſſe, but wickedneſſe alſo.</hi> Which is as much to ſay (me thinks) as this; If a man ſhould ſet forth the doctrine of Reprobation in its colours, and explaine it to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a cleare and lively faſhion, he would hereby open a doore to liberty and prophaneneſſe.</p>
            <p>The other witneſſe is a man of another ſtamp, the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Landgrave of <hi>Thuring,</hi> of whom it is recorded by <hi>Heiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bachius,</hi> that being by his friends admoniſhed of his vitious converſation and dangerous condition, he made them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; <note n="(g)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>I conclude therefore, that by this opinion (which is taught for one of Gods principall truths;) Religion eyther is or may be made a very great looſer, which is my fourth generall Reaſon againſt it.</p>
            <p>But there are three things which are uſually anſwered to vindicate this opinion from this crimination.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that many of them which beleeve and defend this doctrine, are holy and good men: and therefore of it ſelfe it openeth no way for liberty of life, but through the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, who uſe to pervert the ſweeteſt and ſureſt truths of Scripture to their own damnation. The like defence to this, did the Epicures of old make in favour of their ſenſuall and Swiniſh doctrine; which was, that happineſſe conſiſted in pleaſure. They ſayd that many of their Sect were honeſt men, and ſo much <hi>Tully</hi> granteth to be true, but with excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill againſt their doctrine. <note n="(h)" place="margin">

               <hi>As other mens doctrines are eſteemed to be better then their deeds; ſo theſe mens deeds ſeeme to me to be better then their doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like to this anſwer of <hi>Tully</hi> to the defenders of Epicuriſme, will I ſhape mine.</p>
            <p>It cannot (I confeſſe) be denyed, that many of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are godly men; but it is no thanks to their opinion, that they are ſo; (the true and naturall genius of which is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſloth, to drowne men in ſecurity, and to countenance car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall liberty:) but to ſomething elſe, eyther to Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (who will not ſuffer this doctrine for his own glories ſake and the good of men, to have any great ſtroke in their lives;) or to mens incogitancy, who think not of reducing it <hi>[ad praxim]</hi> to practice, and drawing concluſions out of it, but reſt in the naked ſpeculation of it, as they do of many others; or laſtly, to ſome good practicall concluſions, which they meet with in the word of God, and apply to their lives (as they do not the former deductions;) ſuch as theſe are for example; <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy. Without Holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God. Jf ye conſent and obey, ye ſhall eate the good things of the land. Godlineſſe hath the promiſes of this life and of the life to come, &amp;c.</hi> And hence we may learne to meaſure this opinion, not by the lives of ſome few of the men that hold it, but by the ſequels, which the logick even of ſimple men, if they ſhould apply their braines to conſider it, would fetch out of it. No man that hath throughly ſuckt it in, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the force of it, but will eyther quite relinquiſh it, or live according to the naturall importment of it, that is, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is ſayd, that albeit this doctrine teach, That men are abſolutely elected, or abſolutely reprobated: yet,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) It tells no man who in particular is elected, who rejected.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) It teacheth that men muſt get the knowledge of their Election by good works, and ſo by conſequent, doth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177938:53"/>
rather encourage, then ſtifle holy and honeſt indeavours:</p>
            <p>For anſwer to the firſt of theſe; The ignorance of a mans particular ſtate (in my judgment) doth not alter the caſe a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot. For he that beleeveth in generall, that many and they the greateſt company without compariſon, are inevitably ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to deſtruction, and a few others to ſalvation; is able out of theſe two generall propoſitions, to make theſe particular concluſions, and to reaſon thus with himſelf: Eyther I am abſolutely choſen to grace and glory, or abſolutely caſt off from both. If I be choſen, I muſt of neceſſity beleeve and be ſaved; if I be caſt off, I muſt as neceſſarily not beleeve, and be damned.</p>
            <p>What need I therefore take thought eyther way about meanes or end? My end is pitched in heaven and the meanes too; my finall perſeverance in Faith and my Salvation, or my continuance in unbeliefe and my damnation. If I lye under this neceſſity of beleeving and being ſaved, or of dying in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe and being damned; in vaine doe I trouble my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout meanes or end, I have my <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> I may take mine caſe and ſo I will: enough it is for me to ſit downe and wait what God will doe unto mee. Thus (it is likely) did <hi>Tiberius</hi> reaſon with himſelf. For <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports of him, that he was <note n="(l)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Suet. de vit. Tib. c.</hi> 69. <hi>p.</hi> 180. Circa Deos &amp; religiones negligentior, quippe addictus Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae, perſuaſioniſque plenus omnia fato agi.</note> 
               <hi>The more negiigent in religion, becauſe he was fully perſwaded, that all things came to paſſe by deſtiny.</hi> And in this manner (it is to be feared) doe too many reaſon in their hearts, and by this very ground (though they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps acknowledge it) encourage themſelves in prophaneneſs. Though men cannot hide their wickednes, yet they will hide their grounds, which fleſh them in it, either through mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, or to avoyd ſome further ignominy: <hi>The foole hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God. Pſal.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>To the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. I anſwer, that men ordinarily will not thinke the getting of the knowledge of their election (if that be all) worth all thoſe painfull duties of religion, that are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and all thoſe ſweet and pleaſing ſinnes which are to be relinquiſhed, they will reſt contented without it for a while, rather then pay ſo dearly for it: and the rather, becauſe</p>
            <p n="1">1 When they have gotten it, it is in moſt but a weak and conjecturall knowledge, obſcured with many cloudes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties.</p>

To the retaining of it is required a continuall indeavour to keep a cleare conſcience, which is irkeſom and tedious. Men therefore had need of a ſtronger motive to obedience then this is, or elſe they will do nothing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they that defend and teach this abſolute reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (ſay they) doe earneſtly exhort men to good works, and deny that any can be ſaved, except they live honeſtly.</p>
            <p>So much was alſo ſayd in the behalf of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> viz. That he denyed that any man that lived not honeſtly, could live pleaſantly. But <hi>Tully</hi> anſwereth roundly: <note n="(m)" place="margin">

            <p n="1">I. Firſt, this Doctrine leadeth men into Temptation, and into ſuch a one too, as is as ſharpe and dangerous as any the Tempter hath. The Divell can eaſily perſwade a man that maketh abſolute reprobation a part of his creed, that he is one of thoſe abſolute Reprobates: becauſe there are farre more abſolute Reprobates (even a hundred for one,) then abſolute

In that writing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That he was of <hi>Calvins</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion, that men are not dealt withall <hi>[ſecundúm bona aut mala opera] ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works good or evill;</hi> but that there are <hi>[oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultiores cauſae] more hidden cauſes</hi> of mens eternall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) That he was one of that wofull Company of abſolute Reprobates; <hi>[Vas formatum in ignominiam] a veſſell prepared to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177938:55"/>
diſhonour:</hi> and that therefore (though his life had been none of the worſt) he could not poſſibly be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) That being unable to beare thoſe dreadfull apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of wrath, with which he was affrighted, he hang'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For theſe are ſome of his laſt words there recorded: <note n="(u)" place="margin">Diſcedo igitur ad lacus infernales ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum dedecus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae meae: Deo vos co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendo, cujus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordia mihi ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata eſt:</note> 
               <hi>I goe to thoſe infernall lakes, an eternall reproach to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I commend you to God, whoſe mercy is denyed</hi> to me.</p>
            <p>Out of this example, two things we may ſafely collect.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That men who think there are many whom God hath utterly rejected out of his onely will and pleaſure, may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily brought to think by Satans ſuggeſtion that they are of that company.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That this Temptation is very dangerous.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore this firſt part of my laſt reaſon, which is; That abſolute Reprobation leadeth men into temptation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It leaveth men in Temptation: and this it doth two wayes; by,
<list>
                  <item>1 Making the tempted uncapable of true comfort.</item>
                  <item>2 Making Miniſters unable to give true comfort.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 It maketh the Tempted uncapable of true comfort: like a Gorgons head, it doth ſo trouble their fancies and amaze them, eſpecially in their paroxyſmes and fits, that the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt arguments of comfort, applyed with as much art and cunning as may be, will not faſten upon them. With <hi>David</hi> they ſay in their feare, that <hi>all men are lyars,</hi> namely all ſuch as come to comfort them in their temptation. The reaſon is, becauſe it is an opinion incompatible with any word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that can be miniſtred to the diſtreſſed Soule in this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Gods love to mankind, CHRISTS death for all men, the calling of poore ſinners without exception, to repentance and ſalvation, with all other grounds of conſolation; the tempted will eaſily elude with the grounds of his opinion.</p>
            <p>Which that we may the better ſee, let us imagine that we heare a Miniſter and a Tempted Soule, reaſoning in this or the like manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tempted.</hi> WO is me; I am a Caſt-away: I am abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely rejected from Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Diſcourage not thy ſelfe thou poore afflicted
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177938:55"/>
ſoule: God hath not caſt thee off. For he hateth nothing that he hath made, but beareth a love to all men, and to thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tempt.</hi> God hateth no man as he is his Creature, but hee hateth a great many as they are ſinners in <hi>Adam.</hi> And God hath a two-fold love (as I have learned) a generall love, which putteth forth it ſelf in outward and temporall bleſſings only, and with this he loveth all men: and a ſpeciall love, by which he provideth everlaſting life for men; and with this he loveth onely a very few, which out of his alone will and pleaſure he ſingled from the reſt. Vnder this generall love am I, but not under the ſpeciall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Min.</hi> Nay but God ſo loveth all men, as that he deſireth their eternall good: for the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>He would have all to be ſaved, and he would have no man to periſh,</hi> nor thee in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tempt.</hi> (All) is taken two wayes: for all ſorts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, high and low, rich and poore, bound and free, &amp;c. and for all particular men in theſe ſeverall ſorts and ranks. God would have all men to be ſaved in the firſt ſenſe: that is, all ſorts; but he would not have all to be ſaved in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſenſe, that is, all particular men of thoſe ſorts: ſome of my country, my calling, my condition of life, but not all and every one, nor me in particular. Or if it be true, that God would have all particular men to be ſaved; yet he willeth it only with a revealed will, not with a ſecret: for with that he will have millions to be damned. Vnder this revealed will am I, not under the ſecret.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Min.</hi> Nay but CHRIST came into the world to ſeek and to ſave what was loſt, and is a propitiation not for our ſinnes onely, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſinnes of a few particular men, or the ſinnes of all ſorts of men, but for the [whole] world. Therefore he came to ſave thee, and to be a propitiation for thy ſinnes: for thou art one of the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tempt.</hi> The [world] as I have heard, is taken two wayes in Scripture: largely for all mankind, and ſtrictly in a reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſignification, for the elect, or for beleevers. In this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, CHRIST dyed for the world, namely, for the world of the Elect, for the world of Beleevers. Or if it be true, that he dyed for all mankind, yet he dyed for them but after a ſort:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177938:56"/>
he dyed for them all <hi>[dignitate pretii]</hi> he did enough to have redeemed all, if God would have had it ſo; but he did not dye for all <hi>[voluntate propoſiti.]</hi> God never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he ſhould ſhed his bloud for all and every man, but for a few ſelected ones onely, with whom it is my lot to be numbred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Min.</hi> God hath founded an univerſall Covenant of peace with men upon the Mediators bloud: and therefore he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſhould be ſhed for all men univerſally. He hath made a promiſe of ſalvation to every one that will beleeve, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth none, that do not exclude themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tempt.</hi> God purpoſed that his Sonne ſhould dye for all men, and that in his name ſhould be preached and offered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes to every one; but yet upon condition they will repent, beleeve, and doe that which hee meaneth the greateſt part of men ſhall never doe, nor me among the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Min.</hi> God hath a true meaning that all men who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhould repent and beleeve; that ſo they might be ſaved; as he would have all to <hi>be ſaved,</hi> ſo he would have them come to <hi>the knowledge of the truth,</hi> and as he would have <hi>no man to periſh,</hi> ſo he would have <hi>all men to repent;</hi> and therefore he calleth them in the preaching of the word to the one, as well as to the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tempt.</hi> God hath a double call; an outward by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word in mens eares; an inward by the irreſiſtible work of the Spirit in their hearts.</p>
            <p>The outward call is a part of Gods outward will: with that he calleth every man to beleeve: the inward and effectuall call is a part of his ſecret will; and with that he calleth not every man to beleeve, but a very few onely, whom he hath inevitably ordain'd to eternall life. And therefore by the outward call, which I enjoy among many others, I cannot be aſſured of Gods good will and meaning, that I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, repent and be ſaved.</p>
            <p>By this we may ſee, that no ſound comfort can be faſtned upon a poore ſoule rooted in this opinion, when he lyeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this horrible Temptation.</p>
            <p>The example of <hi>Francis Spiera</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Lawyer, will give ſome further light and proofe to this. This <hi>Spiera</hi> about
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:177938:56"/>
the yeare 1548. againſt his knowledge and conſcience, did openly abjure his Religion and ſubſcribe to Popery, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might preſerve his life, and goods, and liberty. Not long after he fell into a deepe diſtreſſe of conſcience, out of which he could never wreſtle, but ended his wofull dayes in deſpaire.</p>
            <p>To comfort him came many Divines of worth and note, but againſt all the comforts which they applyed to him, hee oppoſed two things eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) The <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of his ſinne: it was a ſinne (ſayd he) of a deep dye, committed with many urging and aggravating circumſtances: and therefore could not be forgiven. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument they quickly took from him, and convinced him by the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> that there was nothing in his ſinne, that could make it irremiſſible. <hi>Peter</hi> that committed the ſame ſinne, and with ſome more odious circumſtances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented and was pardoned, and ſo (no doubt) might he.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) He appoſed his abſolute <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and with that he put off all their comforts. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſayth he) repented indeed and was pardoned, becauſe he was elected: as for me I was utterly rejected before I was borne; and therefore I cannot poſſibly repent or be ſaved. If any man be elected, he ſhall be ſaved, though he have committed ſinnes, for number ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and haynous in degree: but if he be <hi>[ex repudiatis]</hi> one of the <hi>Caſt-awayes, [neceſſario condemnabitur] he ſhall be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably condemned,</hi> though his ſinnes be ſmall and few. <note n="(w)" place="margin">Nihil intereſt an multa, an pauca, an magna, an parva ſint, quando nec Dei miſericordia, nec. Chriſti ſanguis, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ad eos pertinet</note> A Reprobate muſt be damned, <hi>be his ſinnes many or few, great or little, becauſe Gods mercy and</hi> CHRISTS <hi>merits belong not to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Story (recorded by <hi>Coelius Secundus</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> with ſome others who lived at that time and wrote of it to theyr friends;) as in a glaſſe we may ſee the diſconſolate condition of a poore Soule, that is ſtrongly conceited that the greateſt part of the world are abſolute Reprobates, and that he is one of them: he ſticketh ſo faſt in the myre and clay, that he can very hardly be drawne out.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It maketh Miniſters unable to afford true comfort to the Tempted; and this it doth, becauſe it —
<list>
                  <item>1 Taketh from them all ſolid grounds of comfort.</item>
                  <item>2 Leaveth them onely weak and inſufficient grounds.</item>

redeemed and called, to repent and beleeve] is true; putteth it out of all doubt to the underſtanding, that the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory [God will have moſt men to be abſolutely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably damned] muſt needs be falſe, and ſo rayſeth up that poore ſoule which was preſſed downe with an erronious conceit and feare, that it was true. In this manner did <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> (though not in the ſame temptation) releeve a woman per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed exceedingly with a ſtrong perſwaſion, that ſhe and all her children ſhould be damned; becauſe ſhe was buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her children at a certain time when ſhe ſhould have been at Maſſe. <hi>Junius</hi> maketh ſhort work with her, telleth her, that her imployment about her children was a duty pleaſing to God, but the Maſſe was a meere will-worſhip: and ſo (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering her of her error upon which the temptation was built,) giveth her preſent eaſe and comfort. In like manner tell a man who feareth himſelf to be an abſolute Reprobate, that there are no ſuch abſolute Reprobates, and that his feare is but a meere fancy and his doubt a dreame; convince him once by contradictory grounds, that there is no man in the world in that ſtate in which he thinketh himſelfe to be, and you drive out one nayle by another, and expell the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe are the ſword of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which will cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder this Gordion knot of abſolute Reprobation; and theſe are the true Nepenthes of a ſicke and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoule.</p>
            <p>But now theſe true grounds of hope and comfort no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter can make uſe of, that holdeth abſolute Reprobation: nor if he do uſurp them, can he poſſibly mainteyne them againſt the replyes of the tempted, unleſſe he relinquiſh his opinion; becauſe (as I have ſayd) there is a plaine contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and no man is able to maintain two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſpeak contrary things, to be both true, any more then he can make it good, that the ſame thing may have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and no being at the ſame time. For example, A miniſter commeth to comfort a man that thinketh himſelfe to be an abſolute Reprobate, and how doth he ſet about it? He telleth him, that God would have all to be ſaved, that CHRIST dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But what right hath he to theſe grounds of comfort ſeeing he holdeth the contrary concluſions, viz. that God will have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:177938:58"/>
a great many to be damned, and to have no part in CHRIST? Well: he uſurpeth them notwithſtanding; but is he able to maintaine them againſt the anſwers of the tempted? or can he make a good reply. No certainly, for thus anſwereth the tempted, God would have all to be ſaved with a revealed, but not with a ſecret will: and CHRIST dyed for all men ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, but not intentionally, or if God did intend that hee ſhould dye for all, yet he intended it upon a condition, which he purpoſed the moſt ſhould never performe.</p>
            <p>What can the Miniſter reply to this? If he will make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect reply, which ſhall take away the anſwer, he muſt deny that God hath two wills, the one oppoſite to the other, a ſecret will that many ſhall unavoydably be damned, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will that all men may be poſſibly ſaved. And he muſt alſo deny, that God had an intent, that CHRIST ſhould not dye for a great many, or that he intended be ſhould dye for all upon condition, they would beleeve or repent, and yet purpoſe that the moſt ſhould never beleeve or repent. But can he deny theſe things? he cannot, except he deny his owne concluſion, which is, that there are many thouſands eternally and unavoydably rejected in Gods abſolute purpoſe from grace and glory. For that concluſion is all one with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of the Tempted, and contradictory to thoſe arguments of comfort, which he is glad to make uſe of.</p>
            <p>Abſolute Reprobation therefore bereaveth that Miniſter who beleeveth it, of all ſolid grounds of conſolation, and ſo maketh him unable to recover a poore Soule wounded with this temptation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it leaveth a Miniſter ſome weak grounds onely and inſufficient to quiet the tempted: and therefore it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him unable to comfort him.</p>
            <p>The grounds which it leaveth him, are inſufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot convince, and make it evident to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Tempted, that he is not that which hee feareth: that is, a Reprobate. Out of temptation probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will uphold a mans hopes (as they did <hi>Manoahs</hi> wives. <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.22.23. <hi>Jf the Lord would kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering at our hands, nor ſhewed us all theſe things;</hi>) becauſe men are not ſo miſtruſtfull then: but in temptation men are uſually very ſuſpicious and incredulous,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:177938:58"/>
like <hi>Jacob</hi> who would not be perſwaded that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and a great man in Aegypt; till he ſaw the Chariote that were ſent to fetch him thither. <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.25. And like <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> who would not beleeve that CHRIST was riſen, till he ſaw the print of the nayles and ſpeare. <hi>Joh.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0.25. They will not beleeve any thing that is ſpoken for their comfort, till it be made ſo apparent, that they have nothing to ſay to the contrary.</p>
            <p>My ſelfe have knowne ſome, who in their temptations have often put their comforters to their proofs, to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, nay to their oathes too, before they would beleeve their words of comfort. And in this temptation (we ſpeake of) men are ſtrongly poſſeſt with the feare of eternall rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the face of God, that they will not eaſily without manifeſt conviction beleeve the contrary.</p>
            <p>But grounds convincing and ſatisfying, a Miniſter that maintaineth abſolute Reprobation, hath not in ſtore: nothing can he ſay, that is able to make it appeare infallibly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably to the underſtanding of the Tempted, that hee is no abſolute Reprobate. All that he can ſay is, Be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: you are a Beleever, a truly repenting ſinner: therefore no Reprobate. For faith and repentance are infallible fruits of Election, and arguments of a ſtate contrary to what you feare. But this the Tempted will deny: he will ſay, that he is no beleever, &amp;c. and how will the Miniſter convince him that he is? He muſt prove to him by the outward acts of Faith and Repentance, (for they onely are apparent to him;) that he doth repent and beleeve.</p>
            <p>But this proofe is not demonſtrative, nor doth convince, becauſe <hi>[opera virtutum ſimulari poſſunt]</hi> the externall acts of Faith, Repentance, or any other grace may be counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Divell may ſeem to be an Angell of light, Wolves may go in Sheepes clothing, <hi>Judas</hi> may make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve by his preaching and following of CHRIST, that he is a true Apoſtle; and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> though he remaine in the gall of bitterneſſe and bond of iniquity, may be thought by his receiving of baptiſme, to be a true beleever: and ſo may any hypocrite by ſome exteriour acts of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance delude the beſt diſcerner of ſpirits among men, and gaine the opinion and eſteeme of a true penitent and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:177938:59"/>
Actions externally good, or good in appearance, may be evill indeed for want of a good rule, manner, end, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good circumſtances, with which an action that is good muſt be clothed. For <hi>[bonum non oritur niſi ex integris:]</hi> and ſo by good conſequence cannot certainly prove the man who doth them to be a good man, or to have the grace of Faith, Repentance, or any other truely planted in his heart.</p>
            <p>Which being ſo, I ſay, that a Miniſter cannot by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts and fruits of faith, and Repentance which he ſeeth come from him, make it evident to the Tempted (to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing of all replyes;) that he is without doubt a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever and repenting ſinner and conſequently no Reprobate. For ſtill the Tempted may ſay, you may be deceived in me: for you cannot ſee any thing more in me, then hath been ſeene in many a Reprobate. And if this be all you can ſay, to prove me to be none; I am not ſatisfied, I may be a Reprobate: nay I am a Reprobate, and you are but a miſerable comforter, a Phyſitian of no value.</p>
            <p>This that I ſay, <hi>Piſcator</hi> doth confeſſe ingenuouſly <hi>in Diſput. de Praed. contra Schafmanu: theſ.</hi> 85. where he ſayth,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That no comfort can be poſſibly inſtilled into the ſoules of Reprobates afflicted with this horrible temptation: from whence it followeth, that the farre greateſt part of men, even an hundred for one muſt beare their burden, (if they fall into this diſtemper and trouble,) as well as they can: the Goſpell is not able to afford them any ſolid comfort.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the Elect being in this condition, may indeed be comforted, but it muſt be by their ſenſe of ſinne and theyr deſire to be freed of it by CHRIST: which proofs are but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable to the beſt, and to a man in temptation no proofs at all: and conſequently either no comforts or very ſmall ones.</p>
            <p>In the end of the ſame <hi>Theſis</hi> alſo, where he ſayth, that a man ſhould reaſon thus with himſelfe; Grace is offered to ſome with a mind of communicating it unto them: therefore it may be that I am one of thoſe to whom it is ſo offered. In this place (I ſay) he implyeth plainly, that the Doctrine of abſolute Reprobation, which teacheth the communication of grace to a very few onely, affordeth but a <hi>[fieri poteſt]</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure I am Elected (and that a very poore one too) for a poore ſoule to comfort himſelfe withall.</p>
